abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze six learning theories, beyond those presented in an earlier article by the authors, and discuss their relevance and application in online instruction. Design/methodology/approach: The following databases were used to review the literature on adult learning theories: Academic Search Premier, ERIC and ProQuest. The following key search terms were used in the search process: online instruction, cognitivism, connectivism, heutagogy, social learning theory, transformative learning theory and Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development. The titles of the identified articles were first reviewed for relevance, followed by the abstract, before any further review for suitability for inclusion in this article. Findings: The theory comparison revealed that it is critical to ascertain which learning theory best matches an instructional situation and the background of the learners. The selected learning theories differ in several parameters. The theories were critiqued for their contributions to identified elements in promoting learning. The discussed theories suggest ways to improve online learning environments. Research limitations/implications: Many adult perspectives about learning, while called theories, are largely lacking in evidence leading to them becoming theories. Thus, there remains a need for empirical evidence of these theories and their roles in online instruction. Comparisons of the application of these theories for adult learners in online instruction would also be useful in establishing the effectiveness of the various learning theories in different adult learning situations. Practical implications: This paper provides a theoretical lens for adult instructors and instructional designers in incorporating these adult learning theories appropriately in improving online instruction. Originality/value: This literature review uniquely critiques and compares common adult theories as they apply to adult online instruction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Online learning has been adopted in distance education worldwide. The rise of the use of digital technology in teaching and learning has enabled distance education institutions to adopt online learning to reduce costs and improve student success. The purpose of this paper is to investigate appropriate teaching approaches that could be applied in an online learning model to achieve the desired success in student progress without reducing student autonomy. The results of this study indicate that cognitivism, social constructivism and connectivism form the basis of relevant teaching approaches in the 21st century with regard to curriculum and material design. The success of the students' learning is determined by the conducive environment created by the educators using technological means. Teaching approaches, such as community of practice, the integrative approach, apprentice and experiential learning, project- and problem-based approaches, as well as a competency-based approach, seem to dominate the Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) environment in the online teaching space. Students and their lecturers continue to engage after their formal interaction on an online platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

Yet, a significant proportion of online material fails to meet the benchmarks of successful teaching and learning highlighting a need for guidelines on how to structure online materials for effective learning. By presenting learning theories; behaviourism, cognitivism, and constructivism, this paper will highlight and discuss principles that can be applied to online learning contexts. The implications of these principles will be discussed to showcase online learning practices where learning is promoted and learners are actively engaged. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Adaptive e-learning promises to deal with the problems of not considering learner characteristics experienced in e-learning systems. Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism. The learner characteristic that is majorly modelled is learning style. In order to capture different learner characteristics we propose a learner model based on the three major learning theories; constructivism, cognitivism and behaviriousim. © 2019 The authors.},

abstract={This paper aims at proposing an efficient constructive electronic-based alignment (CeA) to promote self-learning amongst the students via e-learning environment where e-lectures/e-tutorials are developed followed by e-assessments. The CeA is developed based on behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism to ensure the students' learning does take place in the e-learning environment. Considering engineering related courses at higher education, it has been shown that the decline in mathematical background of the students causes difficulties in accomplishing the quantitative curricula. A well-designed constructive alignment is thus necessary to support active learning of the students having different backgrounds. Onsite tutorials and seminars may be helpful; however, they may not be very effective, especially in a large-sized and/or high-diversity class. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed CeA not only helps the onsite students strengthen their knowledge but also provides the offsite students with various kinds of learning supplement. Particularly, a case study is presented to show the potential impact of the CeA on both onsite and online learning of mathematics for postgraduate students in both telecommunications engineering and computer networks. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This article presents three intersecting aspects of e-learning: theory, practice, and research. It begins with a review of the major theoretical frameworks to date - behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, digital media theory, and active learning theory - to demonstrate the ways in which e-learning is both similar and dissimilar to traditional modes of learning. The article then turns to a practical case study of e-learning, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the American Museum of Natural History and hosted on the Coursera platform. The case study demonstrates both how learning theory affords a template to guide MOOC creation, and how MOOC platforms can be a laboratory for e-learning instructional design. The article concludes with an example of e-learning research, demonstrating the importance of synergy among theory, practice, and research. © 2018, National Research University Higher School of Economics.},

abstract={In educational discourse on human learning (i.e. the result of experience) and development (i.e. the result of maturation), there are three fundamental theoretical frameworks, - behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism, each of which have been applied, with varying degrees of success, in online environments. An ecological framework of human learning and development in interactive learning environments is proposed. Such an inclusive paradigm organizes the fundamental theoretical assumptions of behaviourism (i.e. automated learning), cognitivism (i.e. recall, understanding, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, creativity, problem solving) and constructivism (i.e. private and shared meaning). Based on review of the literature, behaviourism is best conceptualized as a learning theory; constructivist theoretical assumptions are best applied to cognitive development including private online experience (cognitive constructivism) and shared online experience (social constructivism). Cognitivism is a particularly relevant theoretical orientation in understanding both human learning and development in interactive learning environments. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={As new technologies emerge, more and more people depend on them for a variety of purposes. Now more than ever there is a tendency for technological implications to substitute for face-to-face communication and education. In this paper we attempt to investigate whether the usability and pedagogical factors for quality educational platforms meet the expectations of three dominant learning theories of the past century, which, namely are: behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism. We assign specific factors derived from 9 evaluation models to the 3 learning theories. A list of 15 questions was produced to help evaluators in the assessment of the educational software. Then we evaluated 11 educational websites that aim to help anglophone students improve their language skills e.g. through grammar and spelling exercises. The results show the level of correspondence of these educational websites to the learning theories. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The present theoretical paper aims to develop a grounded model for designing instructional activities appropriate to e-learning and online learning environments. The suggested model is guided by learning principles of cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism learning principles to help online learners constructing meaningful experiences and moving from knowledge acquisition to knowledge creation process. The proposed model consists of five dynamic and grounded domains that assure the quality of designing and using e-learning activities: • Social Domain; • Technological Domain; • Epistemological Domain; • Psychological domain; and • Pedagogical Domain. Each of these domains needs four types of presences to reflect the design and the application process of e-learning activities. These four presences are: • cognitive presence, • human presence, • psychological presence and • mental presence. Applying the proposed model (STEPP) throughout all online and adaptive e-learning environments may improve the process of designing and developing e-learning activities to be used as mindtools for current and future learners.},

abstract={The objective of this paper was to develop a four dimensions dynamic model for designing instructional activities appropriate to electronic and virtual learning environments. The suggested model is guided by learning principles of cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism learning theories in order to help online learners to build and acquire meaningful knowledge and experiences. The proposed model consists of four dynamic dimensions: • Cognitive presence activities; • Psychological presence activities; • Social presence activities; and • Mental presence activities. Cognitive presence activities refer to learner's ability to emerge a cognitive vision regarding the content of learning. The cognitive vision will be the starting point to construct meaningful understanding. Psychological presence activities refer to the learner's ability to construct self awareness and trustworthiness. It will work as psychological schema to decrease the load of learning at distance. Social presence activities refer to the learner's ability to share knowledge with others in a way to construct a community of practice and assure global understanding of learning. Finally, mental presence activities refer to learner's ability to construct mental models that represent knowledge creation. It will help learners to make learning outcomes and experiences transferable. Applying the proposed model will improve the process of developing e-based activities throughout a set of adaptive and dynamic frameworks and guidelines to meet online learner's cognitive, psychological, social and mental presence.},

abstract={The new instructional design model (Isman - 2011) aims at planing, developing, implementing, evaluating, andorganizing full learning activities effectively to ensure competent performance by students. The theoreticalfoundation of this model comes from behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism views. And it's based onactive learning. During teaching and learning activities, learner is active and uses cognitive learning to constructnew knowledge. To construct new knowledge, educational technology materials are used. These materials areconnected with goals and objectives. This study examines the effectiveness of the instructional design model(Isman - 2011) in developing the students teaching skills (Planning Teaching Domain) by redesign "Generalteaching methods course - curr 233-", which taught to the sixth level students at teachers' college, King SaudUniversity. The sample of the study consisted of 80 students that enrolled in the second semester 2010/2011,they were divided into two groups of 40 students each, (an experimental group and a control group). The resultcomes by administered pre- post teaching skills test to find out the model has strong effectiveness in achievingthe research aims especially in developing the student teaching skills. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={The design of a platform for blended learning is dependent on the educational and didactic theories. We discuss behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism and the impact of these theories on the elements of learning platforms. We describe the construction of a learning platform (of the Dept. of Information Science at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany), developed from the results of the didactic theories. The InfoCenter consists of elements of face-to-face teaching, of multimedia mediation (text books, slides, classic texts, interactive videos, FAQ lists, video glossaries), of Web 2.0 tools (wikis, weblogs, social networks, social bookmarking and folksonomies) and of the use of a learning management system (with learning units and tests). The platform was evaluated by its users (university students) by means of SERVQUAL. According to the evaluation, students are satisfied with the InfoCenter and are willing to use it for their exam preparation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The chapter reviews some of the important guiding issues in the development of animations for educational purposes. Animation is situated as a tool in aid of visualization and the development of mental models. In this perspective, it is argued that animations that are designed for educational purposes should, along with the effort to develop new content knowledge, should also seek to enhance the internal models of the learner. It is argued that this can be best achieved by developing animations that are more explanatory rather than emergent or explorative. The choices made in the design of animations are informed by learning theories: Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Situated Learning. A case is made for using animations in guided rather than open inquiry. Together with the principles of multimedia based on dual-coding theory, cognitive load theory, and schema development, a case is made for what constitutes appropriate design and use of animations in education. It is argued that good animation is one that abides by the research-based principles of multimedia learning, is designed with a mind towards a particular learning theory goal, is used in established protocols that target specific learning objectives, and is one that keeps in mind the possible end-use by the learner. Specific examples of design issues and how these may be resolved by a careful reading of learning theory is discussed. The Inductive Concept Construction (IC2) learning system and how it is guided by the principles of good media design and use is discussed. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the usability and interface design of e-learning portal developed for primary schools in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach Using Singapore-based learning EDvantage (LEAD) portal as a case study, this paper reviews and analyses the usability and usefulness of embedded learning objects (LOs) for students aged nine years and above through learning theories such as behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism and interface design theories by Shneiderman, LO review instrument and laws of gestalt psychology. Findings Analysis found the portal to be sufficiently motivating and appealing to learners at Piaget's concrete operations stage. The interface design is universally structured and functional. An area for improvement highlighted in this case study is the lack of explicit mention of learning outcomes in the portal. Practical implications Usability principles used in this case study should be provided by the Ministry of Education in Singapore to schools to ensure more standardized and rigorous selection process of e-learning portals. Originality/value This evaluation provides schools with insights into the use of learning theories and usability principles for evaluation of learning objects designed for primary-going students. It aims to inform decision makers of issues in interactive design to consider before subscribing to any e-learning portals. It also provides a gauge of current usability level of commercially developed portals as usage of such portals continue to proliferate in the Singapore education system. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={The web based Neurolinguistic (NL) computer assisted language learning (CALL) model is a pragmatic and lexical semantic model that wants to foster, from its initial stages, the process of second language acquisition. The model is informed by a semantic theory in which meaning is contextual and dynamic, the result of a process of social interaction. From the perspective of cognitive semantics there is no separation between grammar acquisition and development of lexicon. Within the framework of cognitive semantics, grammatical ization and categorization are not distinguishable. This means that the mapping of meaning onto form implies learning how different lexical-grammatical items relate to one another. The goal of the instructional design behind the NL model is to enhance the depth of processing information that will allow students to identify the intimate relationship between form and meaning. The instructional design of the model is informed by a constructivist paradigm, contrary to the behaviorist paradigm that informs most models of second language learning. Because the instructional design process in constructivist models is recursive, non-linear, the complexity of the instructional design requires more reflective thought on the part of the learners.},

abstract={The paper explores how computer mediated communication can be used to effectively promote critical thinking skills among online learners in higher education. Critical thinking is a process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing and constructing information to become one's own knowledge. The effective use of a new technology needs to be related to how learners learn. This paper attempts to examine the learning theory underlying computer mediated communication and discusses cognitivism, collaborative learning, constructivism and situated learning. The latest technologies in computer mediated communication are investigated further by identifying the potential as learning tools. The definition of internalization may throw light on the key question of this study. Finally, we conceptualize the idea that computer mediated communication could promote critical thinking among learners through internalization within a community of learners.},
