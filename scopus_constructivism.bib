abstract={Aim/Background: Pharmacy educators often incorporate electronic learning or e-learning to facilitate learning among pharmacy students. E-learning can be designed based on the Social Constructivism Theory (SCT). The learning outcomes of e-learning that is developed based on the SCT should be assessed continuously and they should include the evaluation of students’ perceptions on the Social Constructivist Learning Environment (SCLE) of their e-learning. The present study aims to investigate pharmacy students' expectations for their e-learning and evaluate the extent to which e-learning fulfils their expectations. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among the second-and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students in a Malaysian Public University to assess the students’ perceptions on the SCLE of two e-learning components offered in two core courses: Principle of Pathology (PP) and Pharmaceutical Care (PC) using the Constructivist Online Learning Environment Survey (COLLES). Results: All students who were invited to participate in the study responded to the survey (response rate = 100%, n = 336). In general, students had positive but moderate expectations and satisfaction towards e-learning. Students mostly expected e-learning to be relevant to their professional practice. The second-year PP students were satisfied with their e-learning, but the third year PC students rated their experience to be lower than their expectations. Conclusion: As a conclusion, although e-learning that was developed based on the SCT can resulted in SCLE, the expectations of the third-year pharmacy students were harder to fulfil compared to their younger counterparts. This warrants innovation in e-learning content and processes for the third-year students. © 2020, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Technology has drastically improved the existing educational system over the past fifteen years. ‘Self-learning,’ using online platforms, has replaced the traditional rote learning. The umbrella of technology-based educational system incorporates multitudes of learning apps. Byju’s-The Learning App (Byju’s) is India’s largest educational app with over 3, 00,000 annual subscriptions. The learning app uses a blend of content, media and technology to make learning more interactive and interesting among the students. It al so promotes personalized learning among the users. In this context, the current study seeks to expl ore a select group of high school and higher secondary students from CBSE and Kerala State Board and interpret their feedback to examine the transformation from tradition al learning to technology-based personalized learning. This paper also demonstrates how Byju’s app facilitates and improves the teaching-learning experience among the students of Kerala. © 2020 IJSTR.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the internet, learning technology responds to the birth of e-learning with the vast use of a various Learning Management System (LMS) software to facilitate online learning in a structured manner. Moodle is an LMS developed by Martin Dougiamas which has four basic concepts, namely: constructivism, constructionism, social constructionism, connect and separate. Several studies have shown that learning reform that combines Moodle with conventional classes, shows an increase in student knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour. This study aims to compile a student's perception on Moodle-based e-learning model in clinical skills learning in the Medical Faculty. This qualitative case study adopted the 'define' and 'develop' phases of the 4D model of a module development. The informants were 11 fourth-year medical students, at the academic phase of a medical school at Universitas Islam Bandung, Indonesia. This study was conducted using unstructured in-depth interviews and small group discussions. The verbatim data were transcribed using Microsoft Word and analysed using NVivo ver.12 software. Four major themes emerged from the define phase: teaching materials, training evaluation, student's learning styles, and the weaknesses of the conventional clinical skills training. This research described that conventional way of clinical skills learning has many limitations and suggested that the use of e-learning based module such as Moodle, could be used as a blended learning approach and can cover the shortcomings of conventional learning methods in clinical skills teaching of the medical students. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Most current definitions of blended learning refer to a blend of online and face-to-face instruction. It seems that few authors notice the irony that the definition of blended learning does not include the concept of learning at all. The problem with these definitions is that they are devoid of theory and thus lead to trial-and-error research. This paper argues that the definition of blended learning should be built around learning theory and should refer to a blend of direct instruction and learning-by-doing. The paper reports on research conducted to validate a model that puts behavioural and constructivist learning at right angles and considers if the two can occur simultaneously. The model is then placed in the context of a framework of knowledge management and from there a definition is derived that includes context, theory, methodology and technology. © 2020, Academic Publishing Ltd.

abstract={In recent times, there has been a strong focus on moving university teaching away from a so-called ‘instructivist’, lecture-centred mode, in which the focus is on what teachers are doing, towards a more student-centred ‘constructivist’ approach, centred on active learning and students’ own constructions of knowledge. This paper considers the tensions and challenges raised by the ways in which constructivist ideas are being taken up in higher education, highlighting two particular issues (1) the positioning of curriculum knowledge as settled and easily transferable across modes of teaching; and (2) the neglect of important disciplinary differences as a result. These issues are explored in relation to two particular case studies of universities introducing new online learning reforms. These case studies show the problems potentially raised by the limited attention to curriculum in the push for more constructivist pedagogies, including a limited interpretation of what constructivist teaching entails and an inattention to the conditions required for its practice. © 2020, © 2020 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

abstract={This paper presents electronic learning features in Education 4.0 environment. Malaysian government encourages Higher Education Institution (HEIs) to embed technologies in order to prepare future education (Education 4.0). Besides, developing skills among students is important to be more adaptable in changing the environment. Current HEIs using Learning Management System (LMS) has lack of interactive features and non-personalized learning. Therefore, this article set out to analyze the existing literature on e-learning practices in Education 4.0 and to propose e-learning features suits in Education 4.0 environment. Guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method, a systematic review of the Scopus 24 related studies. Further review of these articles resulted in seven principles of e-learning features based on the constructivism principle – Self-regulation, Personal perspective, Experiential learning, Social learning, Learning Community, Creating and Sharing Knowledge, Structure and layout which can be used to upgraded and redesigned LMS.

abstract={Blended learning, a combination of face-to-face and computer-assisted pedagogy, is gaining acceptance at universities as an alternative learning experience. Modern technology has given faculty new ways to incorporate active learning and increase student engagement in their courses. Although the broad history of technology-enhanced coursework has demonstrated that student learning is usually very comparable to what occurs in traditional coursework, recent studies focusing specifically on blended learning in totally redesigned classes report positive results. Were those positive results due to the online blending or to the redesign of the class? To answer this question and other limitations and challenges in past studies, the authors present their unique research that measures learning in a blended undergraduate management information systems course where identical classes were compared, one being all face-to-face and one being one-third online. By varying only course modality, this research answers the question of whether blended learning is a superior learning environment in an undergraduate MIS class, a second-level MIS class covering ERP, business processes, databases, advanced spreadsheets, and data analytics. Collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, the authors use a critical realism lens to create a mechanism for learning. Quantitative data, analyzed by multiple regression models and qualitative data, analyzed by content analysis lead to the outcome that learning is comparable to traditional coursework, grade-wise, but students prefer face-to-face class time. It also reveals that self-regulatory skills are evident, confirming that blended learning can aid in the construction of learning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Online learning has been adopted in distance education worldwide. The rise of the use of digital technology in teaching and learning has enabled distance education institutions to adopt online learning to reduce costs and improve student success. The purpose of this paper is to investigate appropriate teaching approaches that could be applied in an online learning model to achieve the desired success in student progress without reducing student autonomy. The results of this study indicate that cognitivism, social constructivism and connectivism form the basis of relevant teaching approaches in the 21st century with regard to curriculum and material design. The success of the students' learning is determined by the conducive environment created by the educators using technological means. Teaching approaches, such as community of practice, the integrative approach, apprentice and experiential learning, project- and problem-based approaches, as well as a competency-based approach, seem to dominate the Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) environment in the online teaching space. Students and their lecturers continue to engage after their formal interaction on an online platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Type analysis of MOOCs is a basic research. In reality, MOOCs are usually divided into cMOOC and xMOOC, which is reasonable to some extent, but not universally explanatory. Mainly based on Lisa M. Lane's opinion that MOOCs contain network-based, task-based and content-based MOOC, task-based MOOC (tMOOC), a relatively independent MOOC, is different from the others. It respects differences of learners' previous knowledge and the uniqueness of knowledge creation according to Constructivism Learning Theory and the main aim at acquiring specific skills in generating knowledge. This paper also analyzes typical application of it when applying MOOC. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Learning progression research has the capability to connect thinking in the education sciences and geography. Learning progressions provide a map of the various pathways that students take to master a topic. The aim of this paper is to illustrate significant conceptual ties between learning progressions and disciplinary geography. Two construct paradigms overlap to form an entryway between educational and geographic thought: constructivism from education and possibilism within geography. The learning progression method can form a bridge between the two paradigms. Learning progression research in geography depends on being able to answer two questions. First, which geographic concepts should be tracked? Given the ongoing changes in global human-environmental systems, priority could be dedicated to the topics that stimulate synthesis thinking about the human-environment relationship in the Anthropocene, or "Age of Humans." Second, how should geographers track advancement in learning about human-environment concepts? Learning progression research provides a method to document multiple aspects of advancement in student learning. But, geographic learning does not exist solely in the confines of the classroom. Furthermore, school districts vary in the amount and quality of geography that they allow. New understandings would come from a mixed-methods approach that addresses geographic understandings by the lifelong learner in the context of both formal and informal geography education. © 2019 Review of International Geographical Education Online.},

abstract={As a language proficiency test widely used for overseas study and immigration purposes, IELTS is being accepted by more and more universities and immigration authorities.The number of candidates for IELTS in China is also rising year by year.In recent years, with the rise of online learning, more and more candidates attend classes while using various online English learning apps.However, not much of the study has been conducted about the relationship between the mobile English learning apps and the IELTS test preparation, and the focus on the working adult learners is even less. This paper first introduces the IELTS test, the theoretical basis of the IELTS test, the characteristics of adult language learners and the classification of the current online apps. Then, the author combines the questionnaire survey and interviews with two adult IELTS students taught in the past year. The result shows that the online English learning app directly contributes to the improvement of IELTS listening and speaking study.At the same time, the degree of help depends to a large extent on the motivation and attitudes of the students themselves. © ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

abstract={Feedback in education is predominantly a teacher initiated practice. Even when peers exchange feedback, it is the teacher who initiates and manages it. The same is reflected in the design of online learning environments. But this idea is incompatible with the real world challenges, where individuals are often required to proactively elicit and judge feedback from multiple sources for accomplishing their goals. Interventions to nurture such learner agency in feedback seeking are rare. My study investigates learners’ proactive feedback seeking behavior during a chemistry representational task. Using microgenetic analysis, I examine how the factors related to the learner, task, feedback sources and the tools influence the learners’ feedback seeking behavior. In the preliminary findings, I describe how these factors interact in determining the variables such as timing, purpose, choice of feedback source, mode of seeking and using the feedback received. Ultimately, my thesis objective is to arrive at guidelines that can inform the design of learning environments to better facilitate and improve learners’ feedback seeking behavior. © ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

abstract={The use of a virtual learning environment is increasingly gaining popularity with universities among students and instructors. VLEs is said to increase flexibility and promote independent learning. However, the pedagogical effects and the contribution of instructors in student’s experience of cognitive active learning in these online classrooms is worth investigating. This paper seeks to explore the disparity between students and the instructor’s perception of cognitive active learning experience in a VLE. Consequently, this paper utilizes a phenomenological constructivism approach by using interviews and questionnaires as the primary method of data collection. The results show that instructors believe students are often not intrinsically motivated and consequently do not automatically experience deep learning in the VLE without the appropriate instructional support. The instructor must stimulate deep thinking with a well-formed and probing questions or comments which promotes critical thinking and knowledge transference. This highlights the disconnect between the two instructors and learners in the expectations, attitude towards learning, and the learning environment. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Online and mobile learning resources are becoming more important in higher education as students expect more flexibility and diversity in the educational tools and resources they can access. One of these online resources is educational podcasts. Podcasts offer educators and students a unique way to convey and learn about new information related to an academic subject. Educational podcasts can be classified under different learning styles, strategies, and pedagogies, such as e-learning or hybrid learning, Constructivism, the scaffolding technique, supplemental tools, and cooperative learning. Past literature demonstrates a demand for educational podcasts from both educators and students. The purpose of this study was to perform an exploratory analysis on the use of podcasts in higher education, and to determine the effectiveness of these podcasts on enhancing student learning in a Sport Management Event and Facilities Management class. The research questions we were looking to answer are: Did the podcasts affect student learning? Did the podcasts influence student motivation? And finally, how useful were the podcasts? The results showed that the participants in this study had an overall positive learning experience from listening to the podcasts, and that students fell in between being unmotivated and moderately motivated to listen to the podcasts. The student population, overall, reported being in favor of using the podcasts. The findings from this study help reinforce previous findings about the usefulness and positive learning outcomes from the use of podcasts but highlight the need for instructors to find ways of improving student motivation to use podcasts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The education is enhance in computer technology very fast as in the modern life of development of technology. Accordingly, there is a need for integration between education and modern technology, which actually facilitates communication between students and teachers. Social networks have become an important component in the educational system and are widely used in most higher education institutions, as they improve traditional approaches to learning, transferring classroom education to online learning. Social networks create new opportunities through which information is transmitted, created, mixed, constantly updated and improved by users. The boundaries of communication between teachers and students have collapsed. The students have rights to work in production and also they can create their own contents as by developing their critical thinking by social constructivism. Thus, the learning environment as a whole is affected by these new ways of knowledge provision, and teaching and learning undergo changes and take on new forms. Taking into account these aspects, our research will be focused on the intersection between social network sites, encouraging the sense of community and opening up new opportunities for a motivating and collaborative informal learning process between teacher and students. © BEIESP.},

abstract={The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, a research-based seminal work, provides a structure for integrating a collaborative constructivist approach in course design, implementation, and evaluation. The CoI framework suggests that by fostering three essential elements–social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence–a community of inquiry can be created to promote student engagement and learning. This paper will present the concepts of the CoI framework for social work educators to consider for distance education course design, implementation, and evaluation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Background: An extensive and international evidence base positions professional learning communities (PLCs) as an effective continued professional development (CPD) mechanism that can impact on teachers’ practices and, in turn, students’ learning. The landscape of teacher PLCs is continuously developing; notably through teachers’ uses of social media. Yet, there is limited robust evidence identifying the characteristics of social media PLCs that impact on teachers’ learning and practice. Purpose: This exploratory study examined the characteristics of a specific Twitter-based professional learning community–#pechat. The research questions were: (i) what is the nature of a Twitter-based professional learning community? and (ii) what characteristics of a Twitter-based professional learning community develop learning and practice? Methods: Data were generated from 901 tweets between 100 participants; and 18 in-depth semi-structured elicitation interviews with participants and moderators of the Twitter-based professional learning community. Data were analysed through a process of deliberation, and a relativist approach informed quality. Findings: Two themes are reported to explain the nature of the Twitter-based professional learning community and the different types of characteristics of #pechat that developed learning and practice. The first theme engagement shows how different participants of #pechat engaged with discussions and how moderators played a key role in facilitating discussions between participants. The second theme shared practices shows how discussions between participants of #pechat led to the development of new practices that some teachers were able to use to accomplish particular objectives in their physical education lessons. Conclusion: The analysis of the data provided evidence to suggest that #pechat is a PLC and is representative of an established group of practitioners. These characteristics should be considered in the design of future online professional development experiences. Facilitator or moderator training could support the development of social media based PLCs that subsequently and positively impact on teachers’ practices. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Physical Education.},

abstract={Class enrollment sizes for online learning in higher education, a topic of persistent interest in the academic literature, impact student learning, pedagogical strategies, school finances, and faculty workload. Yet in the research literature, class size is addressed with insufficient specificity to provide enrollment direction. Seeking guidelines for determining online class sizes, the authors conducted a qualitative research synthesis from 43 recent higher education journals, yielding 58 evidence-based articles. It is clear that no one size fits all. Findings reflect that large classes (≥ 40 students) are effective for foundational and factual knowledge acquisition requiring less individualized faculty-student interaction. Small classes (≤ 15 students) are indicated for courses intending to develop higher order thinking, mastery of complex knowledge, and student skill development. Pedagogical intent should dictate class size. Using well-established learning theories, the authors describe current understandings of online enrollments and propose an analytical framework for pedagogically driven, numerically specific class sizes. Highlights: There is academic interest in online course sizes in higher education. Research indicates “no one size fits all” online classes. Class sizes should be based on learning level and identified pedagogical intent. Large classes are appropriate for foundation-level learning. Small classes are appropriate for learning requiring higher order thinking. © 2019, The Online Learning Consortium. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Globally, online learning is widely used as a modern means of delivering instruction. Yet, a significant proportion of online material fails to meet the benchmarks of successful teaching and learning highlighting a need for guidelines on how to structure online materials for effective learning. By presenting learning theories; behaviourism, cognitivism, and constructivism, this paper will highlight and discuss principles that can be applied to online learning contexts. The implications of these principles will be discussed to showcase online learning practices where learning is promoted and learners are actively engaged. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Self-directed learning is a fundamental competence for adults living in our modern world, where social contextual conditions are changing rapidly, especially in a digital age. The purpose of the present article is to review key issues concerning self-directed learning in terms of (1) what are the historical foundations of the self-directed learning concept?; (2) who may benefit from self-directed learning?; (3) who is likely to carry it out?; and (4) what does research show regarding outcomes of the self-directed learning process? The author takes into consideration humanistic philosophy, pragmatic philosophy and constructivist epistemology, which together concern a process of learning that is individual, purposeful and developmental. Potentially everyone can benefit from self-directed learning competence, but both societal and individual factors may influence whether self-directed learning is likely to be carried out. The author discusses a number of empirical studies that examine outcomes of the self-directed learning process in informal/non-formal online contexts and in formal educational settings. Research findings highlight the importance of realising the opportunity to foster learners’ self-directed learning competence in formal educational settings. © 2019, UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning and Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Learning has always been considered a social and collaborative activity. From the social constructivism perspective, students learn through the process of sharing experiences and build knowledge and understanding through discussion. This pilot study demonstrates the successful integration of an online social annotation tool in a Python programming workshop that allows students to discuss learning material and code segments with their fellow classmates. We investigate how the students leveraged the tool to improve their learning and to log their sentiments while reading the material and attempting the programming activities. We find that those students who had access to the annotation tool spent an above average amount of time on the material. They also had a higher completion rate and performance compared to the control group who did not have the annotation feature available to them. Feedback from the students who used the tool was very positive. Finally, we delve deeper into analysing the annotation patterns and explore how instructors can make use of fine-grained annotation data to inform and adapt the design of CS teaching and learning materials in online or blended contexts. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Purpose: Effective ethical leadership is crucial for law enforcement leaders. Ultimately the presence or absence of ethical leadership has significant implications for society. Yet Western law enforcement agencies (LEAs) invest little by way of time, effort or understanding into how law enforcement leaders interpret and develop a sense of ethical competence for leadership. This is a significantly under-researched area within law enforcement anywhere in the world. The purpose of this paper is to assess, measure and more fully understand how social constructivism, problem-based learning (PBL) and self-reflection assist front-line leaders to learn and internalise ethical reasoning for leadership within a law enforcement environment. Design/methodology/approach: The research was designed to assess, measure and more fully understand how social constructivism, PBL and self-reflection assist front-line leaders to learn and internalise ethical reasoning for leadership within a law enforcement environment. Data were collected during a two-day ethical leadership workshop delivered to 13 leaders in supervisory positions from the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police. The pedagogical approach was to blend PBL and self-reflection within a social constructivist centred learning experience and measure changes in the ethical efficacy of the research participants through qualitative and quantitative measures. Findings: The research suggests that blending PBL and self-reflection within a social constructivist learning environment can contribute towards law enforcement leaders’ learning and internalising of ethical reasoning. This is demonstrated through the measurement of ethical efficacy both before and after the learning experience, with particular growth evident towards understanding ethical perspectives and concepts. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the fact that results cannot be generalised due to the size of the case study. This is compounded by the fact that much of the data are self-reported and responses offered by the participants are subjective. As a result, much of the data were subject to the attitudes and personal perceptions of the participants thus making the information subjective. Aside from demonstrating an impactful learning approach, this research has highlighted that amongst contemporary Australian LEAs there has been little effort or progress towards finding meaningful and effective pathways to encourage or grow ethical efficacy. Practical implications: Given challenges faced by LEAs, both Australian and international, the critical need for investment in learning for ethical leadership is both clear and emergent. Law enforcement ethical leadership learning cannot be satisfied through online learning and other cost-efficient means alone. A face-to-face problem-based and reflective learning environment that combines trust, tools and tension in equal measure offers promise for enhanced ethical efficacy. Achieving this requires significant investment in face-to-face learning utilising high-level facilitation skills. Social implications: There is a deep and disturbing malaise within Australian LEAs in relation to ethical leadership development, exacerbated by the dearth of investment directed towards learning for front-line ethical leadership. Australian LEAs sit at the crossroads in relation to their application of ethical leadership learning. Given the recent challenges, if these agencies fail to fully engage with this opportunity, the cost will be unfortunately borne by all citizens. Originality/value: The implication is a clear need to understand and establish the most effective way for law enforcement officers to grasp the importance of ethics and in doing so, learn ethical leadership. Understanding how law enforcement leaders interpret and develop a sense of ethical competence for leadership is a significantly under-researched area within adult learning and there is little evidence of similar effort within law enforcement anywhere in the world. The overarching objective of this research therefore was to identify pathways that strengthen and enhance ethical leadership as an enabler towards achieving just and corruption-free law enforcement services for the communities. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper aims at reviewing and applying constructivism, as a learning theory, in the design and development of automated technologies for Massive Open Online Courses in higher education. Although new in the field of online education, these courses hold the promise of ensuring many people get access to higher education. As it promises many advantages, its multiple challenges also lurk around. Applying the right learning theories would provide a platform that delivers a learning environment which is both automated (to account for the high number of users) and personalized. The methodology uses big data technologies and natural language processing skills to provide quality interaction between platform and student. A review of the types of MOOCs is done, and the challenges of delivery and assessment which limits its recognition as a standard means of education. Then, the use of software agents is explored to accommodate for the stream of big data generated by the high number of students. Learning theories and styles, which are relevant in the design of these courses, are also discussed. Finally, a model is proposed which employs software agents and constructivism (as a learning theory) to make massive open online courses more student-oriented. © 2019 IEEE.},

In 2013, a grant of $835,000, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was dedicated to setting up MOOC Research Initiative with the goal of increasing the availability and thoroughness of research around MOOCs [2] This paper has reviewed several issues regarding MOOC platforms. To do this required taking a review of the state of art of MOOCs and the current research trends that are ongoing to tackle the challenges. Three major areas have been specifically considered.},

abstract={Adaptive e-learning promises to deal with the problems of not considering learner characteristics experienced in e-learning systems. Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism. The learner characteristic that is majorly modelled is learning style. In order to capture different learner characteristics we propose a learner model based on the three major learning theories; constructivism, cognitivism and behaviriousim. © 2019 The authors.},

abstract={Billiards is a sport that not only requires numerous skills, but also emphasizes the strategies of planning the path of the contact and shot. Traditional billiards training mainly focuses on skills practicing, while the strategies for facing different kinds of challenges in billiards competitions are usually ignored. Therefore, referring to social constructivism, the current study proposed an ASQI (annotation, summarizing, questioning and interflow) mobile flipped learning approach to strengthen students' pre-class learning effectiveness via engaging them in social interaction contexts to share experience and strategies of dealing with different billiards competition cases. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The participants were 80 university students from two classes; one class learned with the ASQI mobile flipped learning approach while the other adopted the traditional flipped learning approach. The results showed that ASQI could significantly enhance students' billiards skills performance and online learning engagement with no influence on task load. In addition, according to the students' feedback, ASQI could help students "make effective use of strategies," "improve learning performance" and "promote reflection.". © 2019, National Taiwan Normal University.},

abstract={The extensive use of social media has encouraged university teachers to consider employing social media as new e-learning platforms. This study explored the relationship between social media usage and constructive learning performance (perceived group task performance). Specifically, this work focused on the mediating role of communication in group and the moderating role of tie strength in online social networking. Survey data were collected from students in a senior-level business course. Students were asked to express their opinions on Facebook usage, communication in group, tie strength, and group performance. SmartPLS was used as the major data analysis tool. Results revealed that frequent social media usage of students led to increased communication among group members and that communication in group enhanced the perceived group task performance of students. Finally, tie strength negatively moderated the relationship between social media usage and communication in group. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Although MOOCs have not lived up to previously breathless predictions of disruption, they have had an outsized influence on university administrators who see online learning as a “savior solution” for ever-shrinking budgets. Despite lower student persistent rates, faculty skepticism, and burdensome faculty workloads, the general public and administrative embrace of online learning has been enthusiastic, which may be explained in part using Foucault’s concept of the episteme to view the convergence of the parallel tracks of educational and technological development--the idea of a kind of mechanism for learning. While MOOCs once promised “best professors,” other institutions now promise the “best designed” mechanisms for learning, certified through corporatized quality assurance programs and learning management systems. While this may be appropriate for shopping educational products in a neoliberal marketplace, it seldom addresses human needs. Moreover, the temporal and human constraints that online promises to banish, in fact, continue to exist. Therefore, a more realistic examination of psychological and social factors, pedagogical tools, and the nature of online communication, is needed in order to create a more humane way of teaching, and learning. © 2018, © 2018 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.},

abstract={Teaching, and education in general, remain firmly rooted in the practices of the past and continue to resist the implementation of strategies and theories arising from educational research. Consequently, significant reforms have been slow to take hold in educational systems around the world. Much of the reluctance can be attributed to a widely-held misconception of the nature of learning. This project attempts to address this misconception through the development of Professional Development Learning Environments (PDLEs are a series of learning tasks and a video-based case study) embedded in an online learning environment that requires the collaboration of users to solve problems. To use a Problem-Based-Learning (PBL) approach in an online context requires a major paradigm shift as well as using tools that were not designed specifically for such a student-driven, process-centred pedagogical paradigm. This becomes a problem when online resources and systems are used for supporting in-service teacher in their pursuit of furthering their education. Although the current theories of learning and teaching may present the philosophical content of such courses, the online strategies used often conflict with the theory. To study the formal implementation of PBL as a social-constructivist pedagogical approach, into an online learning environment to provide the tools for e-learning that would be closer in design to the current thinking on the very nature of learning, the PDLEs were modified to become small reusable video clips with a structure designed to facilitate PBL and focus learners’ attention on higher order thinking skills rather than specifically on content. These modified PDLEs are referred to as Problem-Based Learning Objects (PBLOs). The PBLOs were embedded into a prototype of a Collaborative Online Learning Environment (COLE) which was developed simultaneously. The entire system was pilot tested with small groups. Preliminary results show that although many technical difficulties remain to be solved, using the environment does show evidence of some effect on beliefs about personal theories of learning, causing shifts from technical issues to those surrounding processes of learning. Our preliminary research has called attention to the potential ability of PBLO/COLE to disrupt conventional, transmission-based conceptions of online learning as content delivery. At the same time, however, our preliminary work has also indicated that learners who are not used to the collaborative opportunities provided within PBLO/COLE may still hold traditional orientations to teaching and learning as a “gold standard” to which all other options are compared. A purposeful direction for our future research will entail working with learners in PBLO/COLE over a sustained period so that they may engage in an online experience grounded in principles of socio-constructivism. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Cultural heritage institutions are spending considerable effort and resources to provide online access to their collection catalogues and collection management systems, usually through their institutional websites. This improves accessibility and supports research and engagement by diverse user groups, as well as meeting the increasing expectation by audiences that this type of information will be freely and easily available online. However, cultural organisations have not responded to these needs in the same way and have been employing different web tools and features to present their collections online. In this article, we argue that the technological implementation choices and the type of content provided reflect also the philosophy of communication of the institution itself. We used the constructivist approach's learning theory and theory of knowledge and combined these interrelated epistemological and cognitive perspectives to analyse the communication philosophy of a large number of museum online catalogues. The article presents the research carried out initially in 2007 through 2009 and then again in 2017, studying the provision of collections information online by different types of museums across Europe and in the United States. This enabled us to establish categories of presentation types and study the changes over time. The results highlighted the major shift towards participatory practices which have been transforming the cultural heritage world over the past years. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

funding_text 2={This article makes a significant contribution in this area because museum websites online collection catalogues have not been analysed in sufficient depth and breadth. It addresses the need to systematically examine a substantial number of museum websites from different countries, in this case across Europe and North America; analyse changes over a long period of time, taking into account these complex interrelationships; and link theory and practice, particularly learning and knowledge theories, to study the provision of online collections information in the context of the organisation’s communication paradigm. The article is based on the findings of a research project which spanned from 2007 to 2009, funded by an FP6 Marie Curie EST grant to investigate the online provision of museum catalogues, the users’ profile, and pattern of use. This was later expanded with additional case studies, comparing the original findings to new ones from 2017. This allowed the examination of change over time—an important aspect rarely addressed in digital heritage research.},

abstract={Due to a dearth on research studies on Flipped Classroom (FC) approach using Learning Management System (LMS) in the Philippines, especially on its effectiveness on students' achievement, this research fills in the need for one. This study is mainly focused on gathering empirical measurements on the effects of employing FC approach using Gooru Learning Management System (GLMS) on the students' achievement in Physics. Using an FC model via LMS on learning concepts and developing self-regulated skills are prominently influenced by the principles of constructivism and connectivism. In an FC model, a free online LMS, Gooru, was used as means for the researchers to facilitate in creating, delivering and conducting learning contents, while simultaneously monitoring learner's participation and assessing the performance through mobile learning device and/or personal computer. This study determined (1) if the performance of a group of students improved using FC approach via GLMS, and (2) if there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest mean scores on students' Physics achievement. Results suggested that employing an FC model with the utilization of Gooru LMS is claimed to be a potential method in increasing students' achievement in Physics. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The purpose of this parallel convergent mixed methods study was to characterize organic chemistry students' expression of electron-pushing formalism skills who had participated in peer-led team learning (PLTL) and cyber peer-led team learning (cPLTL), a synchronous online version of peer-led team learning (PLTL) workshops. A new electron-pushing formalism analytic framework was developed from a review of the literature in addition to analysis of students' interview artifacts, using a constant-comparison process. Utilization of this new electron-pushing formalism analytic framework for coding student interview artifacts revealed that cPLTL students were significantly less likely to successfully draw the product suggested by the curved arrows than their PLTL classmates. Implications for instructors are suggested, including encouraging students to verbally explain their rationale while drawing mechanisms as well as optimizing graphical collaborative learning activities for online learners. © 2018 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

abstract={This paper is a qualitative narrative examination of undergraduate students’ experiences in a fully online learning community. The author describes how a community of 90 students divided into three sections of 30 participated for 12 weeks in a blended course using flipped classroom video podcasts, online discussion boards, and weekly synchronous Adobe Connect conferencing. Through a combination of modules, students developed their creativity and critical reflective skills within a problembased learning community. The theoretical framework used to analyze the learning community is based on the role of creativity in an academic context (Brearley, 2000), arts-based qualitative inquiry and pedagogy (Barone, 2006) and critical reflective practice (Greenwood, 1992; Griffin,2003); Hickson, 2011; Higgins,2011; Schon; 1987). The paper describes how opportunities for creativity, intuition and greater self-direction in a problem-based learning (PBL) environment helped develop a critically reflective learning community. Specifically, digital moments, or multimedia digital narratives were used by students to describe their experience in fully online learning communities. In addition, participants developed ownership of the learning experience by co-creating the learning tasks, the assessment criteria, and allowing creativity into the production of assignments. The paper also examines students’ notions of learning and teaching. The author discusses the necessary deconstruction of previously held concepts about the roles of teachers and learners in online communities in order to reconstruct an environment that embraces creative thinking, mistakes and innovation. Finally, best practices in digital pedagogy are explored through a qualitative account of the creativity, constructivism, shared learning and critical reflective practice that have essential roles to inform learning in the digital age. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Included in the discussions regarding the instructional and learning value of massive open online courses (MOOCs) is the question of whether MOOC learners gain much value, if any at all, and has been a continuing debate since MOOCs began. Skeptics argue that MOOCs lack academic rigor and are superficial, while proponents praise them as addressing important global issues of educational access and affordability, providing pathways to more substantial learning opportunities. An important viewpoint in this conversation that warrants consideration is that of the professors/instructors who teach MOOCs and how they perceive the quality of learning that takes place in their MOOCs. In this case study, we used semistructured qualitative interviews with three MOOC instructors in addition to course and document reviews to identify examples of their perceptions in practice. The findings from this case study suggest that instructors do believe that quality learning can take place within a MOOC and is often accomplished through social constructivism and self-regulated learning approaches. Discussions, dialogues, negotiations, and collaborations as well as learners accomplishing their intended goals in the course were all considered to be manifestations of quality learning in a MOOC. Implications of the findings for additional research and practice are also discussed. © 2019, The Online Learning Consortium. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this work, we try to demonstrate that the use of the science of information and communication allows the implementation of new tools for online training. In a first reflection we will consider the work on constructivism and socio-constructivism with a look at the work of Hayek and Boudon, to explain the non-normative behavior of learners. This idea will be completed by using the work of Piaget and Vygotsky and the emergence of several models from the SIC, as the linguistic approach to the analysis and the improvement of content. Our work tries to provide some answers, from the theoretical and methodological point of view. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Given that the creation of successful interactions and collaboration networks develops into sustainable and successful social entrepreneurial organisations, learning communities can serve as an ideal environment to train students in social entrepreneurship. This paper describes massive open online learning communities as an appropriate methodology for the distance teaching of social entrepreneurship and how the students on a massive online open course in social entrepreneurship commit to the learning community generated in this virtual environment. Data from a pioneer social entrepreneurship massive open online learning communities were analysed using three statistical methodologies. The analysis demonstrates that a student's commitment to the distance learning community is directly related to his degree of participation, the rewards received, his correspondence with the other students and recognition from the other members of the community. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Over the last years, a growing interest in blended learning, that can be defined as the mixing of online courses with face-to-face courses taking advantage of both worlds [7, 17, 33], has been on the increase. This paper proposes a computerized tool for collaborative authoring of revitalized reusable teaching modules (so-called learning objects – LO) for blended learning. The tool will orchestrate the timing of various classroom activities (e.g. multimedia presentations, team activities, case studies, etc.) and can assist with the way how a learning management system (e.g. Moodle) interact with students. The tool also addresses the need for collaboration when several teachers work on the development of the same course offered at more than one branch of the college. While trying to fill up the gap between objects storage and retrieval standards and the object’s usage in the class context under given learning theory based on constructivism and connectionism, the paper also presents visual metaphors for the described authoring tool. The tool is assumed to save the teacher’s time and energy to make teaching more effective. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={This paper aims to bridge the literature gap concerning the use of social media to conduct collaboration learning and explore its effect on student performance through cyberstalking (CS) and cyberbullying (CB). To achieve the study objective, this study employed a questionnaire as the main data collection method and distributed it to 538 university students based on both the technology acceptance model and constructivism theory, all of whom use social media. The findings were obtained via a quantitative research method, structural equation modeling. This study found a significant relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment with social media use for open learning. However, this study found a negative relationship from social media use on open learning that was dampened by CB, which is considered a dampening factor. Also, open learning was reported to be negatively influenced by perceived usefulness as CS was found to dampen the relationship with open learning. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aimed to alleviate the disparity in the literature regarding social media use for collaboration and communication and its influence on the performance of students at higher education. A questionnaire survey on constructivism theory, technology acceptance model, and communication theory were utilized as the key method for collecting data and was circulated among a total of 863 university students. The obtained outcomes of students' behavioral intention to utilize social media to collaborate learning and online communication indicates a positive effect on their academic works in higher education institutes, while male students were not completely satisfied with interaction with peers for collaboration learning. The study indicates that collaboration learning, as well as online communication over social media enhances, the students learning activities and enable to sharing knowledge, information, and discussions, and hence, we recommend students to utilize social media for education purpose and should have encouraged them through lecturers at higher level education institutions. © 2019 S.

abstract={Distance education or learning has been around for a long time and with the advent of mobile devices like the smart phone, it is inevitable that mobility impacts the distance education arena. Mobile learning in this article is defined as the "mobile" state of the learner. In theory, this amplifies the flexibility of distance and online learning, reducing the significance of geographic location while increasing that of contextuality. The affordances of mobility empower students to participate as part of context-aware ubiquitous learning. There are a diversity of contexts, methods, and technologies used. There is a need to have a stronger connection between mobile technology integration and a learning-theoretical framework to guide research, practice, and policy. It is important to integrate mobile and emerging technologies with education through an appropriate evidence-based learning design framework. © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={Given the rise of social media engagement within society, there are challenges for tutors in blended and online contexts to provide opportunities for social constructivist learning experiences within their institutional learning environments. This article proposes a module approach to teaching, learning and assessment for learners undertaking part-time, vocationally related degrees. A mixed methods approach was adopted to conduct a detailed exploration of eight tutors’ practice with data gathered from three principal sources. Interviews with tutors explored their approaches to delivery and considered factors that impacted on quality; students’ perceptions of their learning experiences were assessed using an attitude survey; and an analysis of the content and communications in the virtual learning environment provided insight into tutors’ online practice. Analysis of modules suggested limited online peer-to-peer interaction, with tutors noting the difficulties of promoting engagement. The article argues for a constructivist approach in this context with a need for tutors to promote a simple module structure, focused around assessment, that creates space for learning. This structure appeared appropriate for these learners, enabling them to manage the influence of daily events, together with pressures and time constraints of work. The findings could aid tutors in designing and delivering courses for similar groups of learners. © 2019, © 2019 HERDSA.},

abstract={Traditional tandem language learning (involving two students learning each other’s mother tongue) is not a new concept. In fact, it has long been practiced in foreign language classrooms. However, a tandem approach involving learners of different countries using social media is something that has not been fully understood. Theoretically speaking, language acquisition occurs when rich comprehensible input is provided to language learners. Unfortunately, not all language learning contexts can provide this vital input, primarily owing to an inadequate language proficiency level of both teachers and students. In fact, this situation is not uncommon in the English as a Foreign Language (hereafter EFL) context. As a result, foreign language learning is hampered or impeded and little learning can occur, if at all. This paper argues that employing a telecollaborative social media-based tandem language learning approach could help to provide the missing input. With this approach, language learners of different linguistic backgrounds (i.e. native English speakers learning Indonesian and native Indonesian speakers learning English) work collaboratively using social media and assist one another in their learning - following the principle of mutual benefit and reciprocity. Teachers of both groups work together to design learning activities for the students with the aim being to provide ample opportunity for language learners to interact with native speakers of the target language and receive comprehensible input accordingly. Thus, a tandem approach by means of social media, such as Facebook, could help provide input critical to foreign language learning at times when input from the language learning environment is so inadequate. More importantly, a tandem language learning approach is compatible with and attuned to contemporary language learning theories such as Language Acquisition Theory and Constructivism. Finally, a tandem approach also promotes a fruitful collaboration among a wide array of educational institutions worldwide which, in turn, foster an international collaboration and networking. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Teachers face multifaceted challenges regarding access to quality professional development. Although technology is increasingly utilized to address this concern, access alone does not ensure effective OTPD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine teachers’ perceptions of the design and implementation of a job-embedded OTPD experience. Supported by adult learning theory and social constructivism, this qualitative multi-case study utilized within-case and cross-case analysis to examine results. These findings, presented through teachers’ voices, included explicit and empirical evidence of six OTPD design and implementation features that address multiple gaps in the extant literature and contribute to an OTPD framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Α major issue that concerns course instructors of massive open online courses (MOOCs) is the low retention ratio of learners. One of the key factors of this problem is the lack of support and interactivity in MOOC discussion forums. The support provided to learners in MOOC forums is critical to retain their motivation. Teaching assistants (TAs) play a crucial role in providing support to learners within the discussion forums, so an interesting research subject is to study the approaches they follow. In this study, we investigate the TAs’ instructional approaches through a mixed-methods approach. This has been performed on two MOOCs delivered through the OpenEdX platform. The goal was to assess the main characteristics of their interventions by using an evaluation framework derived from social constructivism theory and to capture the main issues of their approaches. The results of this study reveal that TAs did not promote problem-centered learning and collaboration, and they acted more as ‘omniscient interlocutors’ rather than as facilitators. Thus, these issues should be addressed, through either a guided learning design process by the instructors, and support to the TAs, regarding their intervention strategy in forums. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Fluid Mechanics is one of the most complex branches of science to learn. Traditionally, it has been taught from a positivism point of view. However, the latest technologies have led to the creation of new educational tools based on a constructivism approach as a complement to conventional teaching. This paper addresses the development of a course to spread knowledge related to Fluid Mechanics. It combines theoretical explanations with interactive applications to allow the student to assimilate the information easier. Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations have been performed to create the educational content shown in the applications. Users will be able to select from different boundary conditions, and the program will display the corresponding simulation results. Therefore, motivation is generated through gamification, retention is generated based on the Multimedia Learning Theory and transfer is generated by inductive teaching. A preliminary version of this course has been launched to a group of users with previous knowledge in Fluid Mechanics. The results indicate how users support the inclusion of multimedia and interactive tools in conventional teaching, because they help them to assimilate complex concepts. Furthermore, the created tool has been endorsed by the users in terms of organization and quality. The adaptation of current resources, such as CFD, to teaching Fluid Mechanics is an evident need that enriches both the student and the teacher. Thus, the educational goals of motivation and knowledge transfer are promoted under the auspices of a constructivism approach. © Copyright 2019 IADIS Press All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article draws on the notion of communal constructivism to explore its potential to frame and facilitate the development of evidence-informed practice. The explicit aspiration to nurture a research-informed workforce is prominent in discourse across policy makers, educational researchers and teacher professional groups in England; however, research evidence indicating how and why teachers might actually use research to inform their practice is limited. Furthermore, the vision for research engagement of itself is not necessarily shared between researchers and practitioners. This study examines the relationships between research and practice when academics and professionals work together. Drawing on data from the co-construction of an online research-informed guide for the teaching of English as an Additional Language (EAL), analysis highlights the complexities inherent in translating research into practice for different stakeholders. Discussion argues for the recognition of communal constructivism as a pedagogy of learning that can build understanding between researchers and practitioners for how practice might become research-informed. © 2018, © 2018 Teacher Development.},

abstract={The context of this work is that of designing an IMS-LD1 model for collaboration space of a LMS2. Our work is specifically in the field or seeking to promote, by means of information technology from a distance. Our approach is to first think about the conditions for creating a real collaboration space between learners, and designing the IT environment that supports this space. In this paper, we try to adapt the IMS-LD model with a collaboration model for Learning Management System based on the social constructivism. This adaptation will go through three stages. Firstly, the development of an LMS model. Secondly, the study of correspondence between the developed model and IMS-LD model. Finally their transformation to IMS-LD model. © 2019, International Association of Online Engineering.},

abstract={MathCheck is a relatively new online tool that gives students feedback on their solutions to elementary university mathematics and theoretical computer science exercises. MathCheck was designed with constructivism learning theory in mind and it differs from other online tools as it checks the solutions step by step and shows a counter-example if the step is incorrect. It has been in student use since the autumn of 2015 and under design-based research from the first online day. The main research questions of this study are the following. 1) How can the usage of MathCheck support the aspects of conceptual understanding and procedural fluency of constructivism learning? 2) How can MathCheck empower both students and teachers in the education of mathematics? This paper presents the results of five pedagogical experiments considering both students’ and teachers’ point of views. In each experiment, the students have suggested improvements, which have affected the further development of MathCheck. In general, both students and teachers have given positive feedback on MathCheck. MathCheck seems to support learning better than tools that only provide the “incorrect”/“correct” verdict after checking the answer. MathCheck is suitable for independent studying as well as an addition to traditional lectures. In the best case, it can reduce teachers’ workload during courses. © 2019 University of Helsinki.

abstract={In computer science education at school, computational thinking has been an emerging topic over the last decade. Even though, computational thinking is interpreted and integrated in classrooms in different ways, an identification process about what computational thinking is about has been in progress among computer science school-teachers and computer science education researchers since Wing's initial paper on the characteristics of computational thinking. On the other hand, the constructionist learning theory by Papert, based on constructivism and Piaget, has a long tradition in computer science education for describing the students' learning process by hands-on activities. Our contribution, in this paper, is to present a new mapping tool which can be used to review classroom activities in terms of both computational thinking and constructionist learning. For the tool, we have reused existing definitions of computer science concepts and computational thinking concepts and combined these with our new constructionism matrix. The matrix's most notable feature is its scale of learners' autonomy. This scale represents the degree of choices learners have at each stage of development of their artefact. To develop the scale definitions, we trialed the mapping tool, coding twenty-one popular international computing activities for pupils aged 5 to 11 (K-5). From our trial, we have shown that we can use the mapping tool, with a moderate to high degree of reliability across coders, to analyse classroom activities with regard to computational thinking and constructionism, however, further validation is needed to establish its usefulness. Despite a small number of activities (n = 21) being analysed with our mapping tool, our preliminary results showed several interesting findings. Firstly, that learner autonomy was low for defining the problem and developing their own design. Secondly that the activity type (such as lesson plan rather than online activity) or artefact created (such as physical artefact rather than onscreen activity or unplugged activity), rather than the computational thinking or computer science concept being taught was related to learner autonomy. This provides some tentative evidence, which may seem obvious, that the learning context rather than the learning content is related to degree of constructionism of an activity and that computational thinking per se may not be related to constructionism. However, further work is needed on a larger number of activities to verify and validate this suggestion. © 2019 Vilnius University.},

abstract={In the past, Jawi script was the main medium of intermediation in Malaya. However, since the emergence of the Roman script, the use of Jawi script has been marginalized causing less awareness among some of the younger generation on the uniqueness of Jawi script. Therefore, 'Oh Jawiku' mobile application has been developed to attracting students to explore Jawi script especially the spelling of Jawi words. This 'Oh Jawiku' mobile application used constructivism approach and ADDIE model during the development process. This study used quantitative one group pre-test and post-test research design that conducted among 20 students of a primary school. The result shows that the mean value of the post-test was higher than the pre-test which is 89.00 while the percentage of students who liked the 'Oh Jawiku' application was high. In conclusion, the application of mobile games 'Oh Jawiku' able to attract students to learn Jawi indirectly raised the dignity of Jawi script in the future besides supporting the 21st- century education. © 2019, International Association of Online Engineering.},

abstract={Along with rise of e-learning, searching services as an important part of e-learning system has attracted more and more e-learners and researchers. According to theory of cognitive development, when e-learners are having problems to understand a concept during online learning, they prefer to search related information to form new cognitive structures or strengthen existing cognitive structures in order to improve learning efficiency. Although the existing search engines are extremely mature, they play a less role in cognitive structures for e-learners. Depending on the theory of constructivism, an effective mean to improve cognitive efficiency is to enhance the improvement and development of individual cognitive structure. Therefore, relying on thinking map, we develop a Linked Open Data-driven contrastive cognitive subgraph searching system for understanding concepts. Besides, during constructing contrastive cognitive subgraphs, we propose a method of calculating similarity between two keywords, whose accuracy and stability have been effectively improved compared with the other algorithm on LOD. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Online instructors are tasked with creating meaningful learning assignments, but they may struggle with balancing their teaching workloads. This article includes five strategies for creating assignments and activities that promote learning without overwhelming instructional workload, including anticipating student questions when writing assignments, creating reusable formative assessments, scaffolding assignments, creating choices for summative assessments, and encouraging student collaboration. These strategies draw from a constructivist learning paradigm while employing the concepts of interactivity, scaffolding, and collaboration. © 2018, Grand Canyon University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to develop syllabus design for university writing education. To invent the architype of university writing instruction for the curricular sequence, a technology-integrated storytelling method was implemented. With the current development of digital technology, more and more people are interconnected through storytelling to each other through various social media or social networks. In the field of education, storytelling has been considered as an effective instructional method that can provide students with entertainment, promote learner motivation, and help students focus on their own learning process. In the recent educational milieu based on constructivism, learner responsibility and learner autonomy become much more crucial than those of the teacher. This phenomenon has reflected the essential concept that the main character of learning is the learner, not the teacher. Owing to the development in technologies, technology-enhanced instructional methods such as flipped learning or blended learning have also become the new educational trends. Consequently, the notion of technology-integrated storytelling method based on learner-centered perspectives becomes more significant than ever, and various online platforms can be served as a powerful network to share stories among people. In this regard, the storytelling instructional method with technology integration can wonderfully match the learner-centered pedagogical approach. In this study, the architype of syllabus will be designed using the technology-integrated storytelling method in university writing education. Learning and teaching strategies will be suggested with the use of technology-integrated storytelling teaching method. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={Following theoretical frameworks including social-cognitive theory, constructivism and creating collaborative learning community, this correlational study elucidates the community of inquiry framework in regard to self-regulation, metacognition, and motivation in an online learning setting. Data were collected from 1535 students enrolled to an online Information and Communication Technology-I course offered by the Department of Informatics at a well-known public university. The data were collected online through Survey Monkey and then analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics using multiple linear regression analysis through SPSS version 23 statistical software. The findings notably revealed that self-regulation, metacognition, and motivation significantly contributed to the prediction of community of inquiry and its three presence types. The findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation for overall community of inquiry and its three presence types due to its significantly valuable contribution. This study resulted in a new tentative model, adding a new construct of regulatory presence, addressing learners’ self-regulation. Further research could concentrate on this new tentative model in addition to the new construct. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Data collected within this qualitative, multiple-case study included teachers' knowledge building preferences for written speech in a virtual community of practice (VCoP), blended learning, teacher professional development program. This data was analyzed using the theoretical tenets of Vygotsky's social constructivist learning theory. Through heterogeneous sampling, six sites were selected from 11 program participating schools, with 11 participating teachers purposively selected from these sites. Following semi-structured participant interviews, data were coded and analyzed, where the findings indicated that participants preferred the audiovisual learning content to the written activity format in the blended learning, VCoP teacher professional development program. Program developers may use the research findings to guide the development of VCoP content alternatives to singularly text based online professional development delivery models.

abstract={This article describes the conceptualisation and development of a pedagogical framework to support the design of e-books for children to enhance literacy development. It emerged from research undertaken within the Q-Tales international consortium project of the EU's Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation, where the aim was to facilitate key stakeholders to collaborate and participate in the online production and publication of high-quality, educational e-books for children. The pedagogical framework described here sought to answer the question “What concepts and principles undergird the effective design of pedagogically impactful e-books for children?” It is grounded by the theoretical underpinnings of socio-constructivism, constructionism and skill theory, and how they relate to children's literacy development. A framework describing different narrative forms and component features, key pedagogical activities appropriate for different stages of reading development and design recommendations regarding the integration of multimedia into e-books are also central to the pedagogical framework. As well as informing the design of the Q-Tales infrastructure for children's e-book design and publication, we hope the guidelines and pedagogical activities enumerated here will be widely useful for those designing and developing digital, interactive narratives, particularly e-books to enhance children's emerging literacy.

abstract={During face to face classroom interactions, learning is facilitated through the dissemination of course materials by subject specialists, in a pedagogical manner, suiting the pace of the learners. It is known that proper interactions with contents, tutors and peers encourage learning to take place. However, the learner-content process is known to be challenging for online learners who struggle alone to overcome learning difficulties, and which may lead them to drop out from the course. In absence of face to face interactions, the content, being the prime source of knowledge for distant learners, has to be up to date and comprehensive while catering for different learning styles of students. Therefore, this paper aims at investigating whether learners meet the cognitive level as required by the course’s learning objectives. Through a questionnaire, 18 online learners were requested to identify their learning activities done in both asynchronous and synchronous modes as part of their learning process. Furthermore, content analysis, using both Activity Theory and the Jaillet & Panchoo grid, was done on four online tutorials to identify if learners study their course materials as desired and if their interactions are of cognitive level. A total of 761 lines of logged textual interactions was coded twice. Results show that learners go through different learning activities as imposed by the module but less emphasis is put on ensuring that learners study the course content before embarking on the assignment. Acquiring the relevant knowledge from the course materials prior to online discussions, will encourage better interactions and learning to take place in this socio-constructivism set up. © Copyright 2018 ACM.},

abstract={This study attempted to mitigate the gap in literature concerning the use of social media for active collaborative learning and engagement and its effect on the research students’ learning performance in the context of Malaysia. A questionnaire based on Constructivism Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was employed as the main data collection method, which was distributed to 723 research students in five Malaysian research universities. Based on the obtained results, male and female students’ satisfaction of social media use for collaborative learning and engagement positively affected their learning performance, although in the case of females, they were not fully satisfied with perceived ease of use and usefulness. The study concludes that overall, active collaborative learning and engagement through social media enriches the learning activities of students and facilitates group discussions, and hence, their use should be encouraged in learning and teaching processes in higher education institutions. © 2018},

abstract={Background: Wiki platform use has potential to improve student learning by improving engagement with course material. A student-created wiki was established to serve as a repository of study tools for students in a medical school curriculum. There is a scarcity of information describing student-led creation of wikis in medical education. Objective: The aim is to characterize website traffic of a student-created wiki and evaluate student perceptions of usage via a short anonymous online survey. Methods: Website analytics were used to track visitation statistics to the wiki and a survey was distributed to assess ease of use, interest in contributing to the wiki, and suggestions for improvement. Results: Site traffic data indicated high usage, with a mean of 315 (SD 241) pageviews per day from July 2011 to March 2013 and 74,317 total user sessions. The mean session duration was 1.94 (SD 1.39) minutes. Comparing Fall 2011 to Fall 2012 sessions revealed a large increase in returning visitors (from 12,397 to 20,544, 65.7%) and sessions via mobile devices (831 to 1560, 87.7%). The survey received 164 responses; 88.0% (162/184) were aware of the wiki at the time of the survey. On average, respondents felt that the wiki was more useful in the preclinical years (mean 2.73, SD 1.25) than in the clinical years (mean 1.88, SD 1.12; P<.001). Perceived usefulness correlated with the percent of studying for which the respondent used electronic resources (Spearman ?=.414, P<.001). Conclusions: Overall, the wiki was a highly utilized, although informal, part of the curriculum with much room for improvement and future exploration. © Michael Pascoe, Forrest Monroe, Helen Macfarlane.},

abstract={Music education, like many disciplines, is transitioning to the online environment, which impacts the learning landscape. This transition, along with a mindshift by instructors, requires careful consideration of the theoretical underpinnings needed to inform the design, facilitation and assessment to create conditions where students are actively engaged in learning and meaning making. The affordance of digital technologies (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous, multimedia) provides a means for creating and articulating knowledge. This chapter discusses online learning and explores the nature of constructivist and social-constructivist theories and how they can be applied in the design, facilitation, and assessment of online music education. Examples of constructivist learning in online music courses are shared for the purpose of examining how technology can be used to support the learning outcomes grounded on social constructivism. The chapter concludes with directions for future research and implications for practice. © 2018, IGI Global.},

abstract={The study in this paper reports on whether an online homework system in combination with a flipped classroom has a positive effect on success rates of first year statistics students. Departing from a traditional teaching model (Baseline), the technology-based intervention strategies implemented were firstly the Aplia™ interactive online homework system (Phase 1) and then, in addition, the flipped classroom (Phase 2). In the flipped classroom model, the transfer of information took place by pre-reading and pre-class Aplia™ homework assignments. This approach intended to allow more quality time to be spent on revisiting difficult concepts and engaging in problems inside the lecture hall, thus enhancing the learning process. The average final marks of the three cohorts were compared using an ANOVA test. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate the effects of the changing teaching models from Baseline through Phase 1 to Phase 2. The success rates of three different cohorts (n = 1485, 1343 and 1466 respectively), consisting of only first-time statistics students with a Grade 12 mathematics mark of at least 60%, were assessed. For Phase 1 compared with the Baseline the increase in the success rate was insignificant, but the success rates for Phase 2 compared with both Phase 1 and Baseline improved significantly with a small to medium effect size, because of the very large samples. The practical importance of this is that the number of successful students increased by more than 100 from Phase 1 to Phase 2 and more than 130 from Baseline to Phase 2. A significant relationship was also found between the different cohorts and their mark distributions, confirming that the online homework system in combination with the flipped classroom in particular is effective in increasing the success rate. © 2018, © 2018 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).},

abstract={The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework was developed by researchers interested in exploring learning in online discussions who grounded their thinking in social constructivist notions of inquiry-based teaching and learning. The i2Flex approach is similarly grounded in social constructivism and inquiry, thus it makes sense to explore the CoI framework with the hope of informing i2Flex models. The purpose of this chapter is to do so. The chapter summarizes the way the CoI framework is conceptualized as developing from the interaction of three presences, and reviews research on the effects of each presence on teaching and learning. The development and validation of a CoI survey and some of the research it has enabled is also discussed. In particular, the chapter examines a course redesign project that significantly improved learning outcomes in four online courses which seems ideally suited the ongoing development of i2Flex classes. The chapter concludes with an examination of two other frameworks for structuring blended learning that might be applicable to i2Flex classes. © 2018, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Knowledge construction plays an important role in determining the effectiveness of learning by focusing on how humans process information and transform it into knowledge. This paper tries to identify the models of knowledge construction process that is suitable for the development of learning environment. The process of constructing student knowledge through a learning system involves an analysis of several types of knowledge construction models used as analytical tools for online learning. The methodology that been used in this paper is thematic analysis. From the analysis, it seems that it is suitable for us to use the Alavi Knowledge Management Process Model to develop a learning environment. Besides, the analysis from Veerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse model also appears to be a better choice as the process in this model able to help construct a social constructivist principle through focusing on non-task related activities to determine the process of knowledge construction. The implementation of online collaborative discussions is said to have great potential to provide opportunities for students to engage intellectually in the process of knowledge construction and in the tradition of cognitive and constructivism learning. Therefore, teachers must be prepared to implement suitable developments and cultures in teaching strategies by providing basic information, involving students to practice and apply relevant skills and implement it in fitting time. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={Introduction: “Flipped” instructional sequencing is a new instructional method where online instruction precedes the group meeting, allowing for more sophisticated learning through discussion and critical thinking during the in-person class session; a novel approach studied in this research. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to document dental students' perceptions of flipped-based blended learning and to apply a new method of displaying their perceptions based on Likert-scale data analysis using a network diagramming method known as an item correlation network diagram (ICND). In addition, this article aimed to encourage institutions or course directors to consider self-regulated learning and social constructivism as a theoretical framework when blended learning is incorporated in dental curricula. Materials and Methods: Twenty (second year) dental students at a Northeastern Regional Dental School in the United States participated in this study. A Likert scale was administered before and after the learning experience to obtain evidence of their perceptions of its quality and educational merits. Item correlation network diagrams, based on the intercorrelations amongst the responses to the Likert-scale items, were constructed to display students' changes in perceptions before and after the learning experience. Results: Students reported positive perceptions of the blended learning, and the ICND analysis of their responses before and after the learning experience provided insights into their social (group-based) cognition about the learning experience. The ICNDs are considered evidence of social or group-based cognition, because they are constructed from evidence obtained using intercorrelations of the total group responses to the Likert-scale items. Conclusions: The students positively received blended learning in dental education, and the ICND analyses demonstrated marked changes in their social cognition of the learning experience based on the pre- and post-Likert survey data. Self-regulated learning and social constructivism are encouraged as useful theoretical frameworks for a blended learning approach. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={This case study describes the collaborative development of an online copyright learning resource at Monash University. The Copyright Module (CM) is a library initiated online educational resource for academics and students. It provides scenario-based copyright information and self-assessment activities for teaching and research. Now at its second stage, the project has engaged stakeholders and collaborators from groups within the Library and beyond. It is an example of close collaboration leading to skills transfer, which has occurred through a process of cognitive apprenticeship, an authentic learning approach, and development research methodology. The formative evaluation process emphasises the learning aspect of the collaboration, making the project innovatively different from traditional learning resource development. The CM has fostered stronger departmental partnerships and the elevation of the profile of the Library within the University. © 2018 Megan Deacon Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Constructivist and social constructivist processes have long been promoted to foster deep learning opportunities for students as active contributors to their learning. A separate but related focus reminds tertiary educators to promote authentic learning in the age of virtual experiences. However, such learning experiences are not always easy to design in online settings. This paper brings these learning concepts together through sharing examples of authentic social constructivist learning designs in the online space, with subjects from the disciplines of Law and Humanities and taught into an interdisciplinary Master of Cybersecurity degree. The learning design examples of the respective subjects are presented and discussed in an authentic social constructivist context. © 2018 ASCILITE 2018 - Conference Proceedings - 35th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education: Open Oceans: Learning Without Borders},

abstract={Socio-constructivism and connectivism theories pinpoint the importance of collaboration for learning. Nevertheless, the online social interactions underlying the collaboration processes are still not well understood. As a result, learning designers have difficulties creating effective collaborative activities in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). As for online learners, they are often isolated and require a lot of self-regulation to succeed. The research effort presented in this paper covers a review of visualization techniques supporting the online collaborative learning process. Our findings show that some visualizations have the potential to develop the learners' reflexivity. Therefore, we give an overview of collaboration importance and how it could be enhanced with such visualizations. Our goal is to identify a new approach to visualize learners' activities in MOOCs, while supporting collaboration and self-regulation.

abstract={There are great concerns about the sustainability of welfare systems and the supply of labour in many European member states due to increasingly aging populations. In the past decade, urged by the European Commission, national governments have tried to motivate more workers to remain in employment beyond their retirement age through various incentives and initiatives that included a more widespread provision of continuous education and training programmes. However, older workers face many challenges to attend classroom-based courses because of their employment, social and family commitments. They want courses that offer more accessibility and flexibility. Online courses can, in part, answer this demand. The transition from face-to-face education to online learning however presents many challenges. This paper attempts to identify these challenges and barriers by exploring the findings of a grounded theory investigation of an online course by the University of Malta. It reports on the students’ experiences and perceptions of their transition from local face-to-face education characterised by schooling practices that are dominated by the transmission of knowledge teaching model, to an online course that uses methodologies inspired by constructivist learning theories. The findings indicate that this shift from brick-and-mortar to online courses may be problematic for non-traditional students who grew up, were educated and worked in a society where banking education practices are pervasive if this shift is not well-planned, gradual and involves a process of scaffolding. In this process, the instructor must play a central and determining role. Through his or her presence, the instructor must create activities, in which dialogue is a key element. These activities must create adequate social and cognitive presences in order to sustain an active and democratic community of enquiry. It is also essential that each student’s motivation is maintained through constant communication and formative assessment tasks, and, above all, the students are treated as adults and their prior knowledge and experiences are built into the course. © Academic Conferences Limited.

abstract={With the ubiquity of interactive games in students’ lives and the rise of gamified experiences across the web and mobile applications, online tutors and practitioners of technology enhanced learning have been inspired to incorporate games-based elements. This paper introduces a prototype of an online application that helps online tutors to embed gaming to design their online course. We developed a framework for online course leaders which explains how Wikis (as an online learning platform) can support students’ learning, interaction, and sharing of knowledge in the online community. We are presenting a metaphor for the course design in a gameboard like “snakes and ladders”. This metaphoric game enables online tutors to elaborate online interaction among their students. The game methodological design approach for this metaphoric game merges different pedagogical theories such as (socio-constructivism) with practice in online learning (Wiki) and gives the online tutor an idea about what theory/approach is used when selecting any technological tool or moving forward in the game. This framework could help tutors, educational institutions and students to use a common language with students to describe their teaching and learning activities. Primarily, it helps tutors to make decisions about learning activities, facilitate, guide and support students’ communication and collaboration. © 2018, Dechema e.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper aims at proposing an efficient constructive electronic-based alignment (CeA) to promote self-learning amongst the students via e-learning environment where e-lectures/e-tutorials are developed followed by e-assessments. The CeA is developed based on behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism to ensure the students' learning does take place in the e-learning environment. Considering engineering related courses at higher education, it has been shown that the decline in mathematical background of the students causes difficulties in accomplishing the quantitative curricula. A well-designed constructive alignment is thus necessary to support active learning of the students having different backgrounds. Onsite tutorials and seminars may be helpful; however, they may not be very effective, especially in a large-sized and/or high-diversity class. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed CeA not only helps the onsite students strengthen their knowledge but also provides the offsite students with various kinds of learning supplement. Particularly, a case study is presented to show the potential impact of the CeA on both onsite and online learning of mathematics for postgraduate students in both telecommunications engineering and computer networks. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing use of digital systems to support learning leads to a growth in data regarding both learning processes and related contexts. Learning Analytics offers critical insights from these data, through an innovative combination of tools and techniques. In this paper, we explore students' activities in a MOOC from the perspective of personal constructivism, which we operationalized as a combination of learning behaviour and learning progress. This study considers students' data analyzed as per the MOOC Process Mining: Data Science in Action. We explore the relation between learning behaviour and learning progress in MOOCs, with the purpose to gain insight into how passing and failing students distribute their activities differently along the course weeks, rather than predict students' grades from their activities. Commonly-studied aggregated counts of activities, specific course item counts, and order of activities were examined with cluster analyses, means analyses, and process mining techniques. We found four meaningful clusters of students, each representing specific behaviour ranging from only starting to fully completing the course. Process mining techniques show that successful students exhibit a more steady learning behaviour. However, this behaviour is much more related to actually watching videos than to the timing of activities. The results offer guidance for teachers. © 2018, Athabasca University.},

abstract={Theories of interactive learning and constructivism have changed museum professionals’ approach to education for children. Online learning has provided unprecedented opportunities for art museums to explore new educational approaches and to expand its educational mission. This research uses the online learning games that the National Palace Museum (NPM) created as a case study to examine the content and design of the interactive learning resources made available via its website. The result suggested that the online learning games might have embraced the interactive features, but lacked well defined educational objectives or curriculum structures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={The purpose of this case study was to identify the learning experiences and examine the challenges facing three international graduate students enrolled in online, asynchronous classes in an American public university. Applying the lens of constructivism, data were collected from a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, and a focus group. Findings from the study indicate that the students faced challenges with English language proficiency, isolation, instructor’s lack of experience, and a lack of motivation to study in online classes. Notwithstanding, students described flexibility and convenience as key factors of the learning experiences in a virtual classroom. Implications for administrators and course designers in understanding student perspectives of online classes and best practices for conducting asynchronous classes are provided. © Journal of International Students.},

abstract={This article presents three intersecting aspects of e-learning: theory, practice, and research. It begins with a review of the major theoretical frameworks to date - behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, digital media theory, and active learning theory - to demonstrate the ways in which e-learning is both similar and dissimilar to traditional modes of learning. The article then turns to a practical case study of e-learning, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the American Museum of Natural History and hosted on the Coursera platform. The case study demonstrates both how learning theory affords a template to guide MOOC creation, and how MOOC platforms can be a laboratory for e-learning instructional design. The article concludes with an example of e-learning research, demonstrating the importance of synergy among theory, practice, and research. © 2018, National Research University Higher School of Economics.},

abstract={The use of serious games (SGs) for different purposes is increasing. The development of successful and effective SGs requires a team with professional knowledge from different areas and a joint understanding of the SG development process. The research goal was to find a way to educate multidisciplinary students via an e-learning course about SGs. An action research study was initiated, and social constructivism theory-based e-learning courses on SGs were developed. The Carpe Diem Learning design method was used in the planning phase, followed by three iterations on course development and implementation. The feedback and observations were analysed in each iteration, and changes to the courses were made according to them. This iterative development and incremental improvement of an online course according to feedback was found to be a good approach. © 2018 University of Maribor Press.},

abstract={Social Care students undertake a research methods module with a focus on quantitative methods. A core aim of the module is for students to develop their research skills by applying them to a project. This paper will explore the student experience of engaging in this process and the impact on their learning and skill development. The impact on the students’ engagement in the exploration of ethical issues and critical thinking is also explored. Bloom (1956) [2] emphasises the key ways that learning happens, with higher levels focusing on Application, Analysis and Synthesis. This research explores the extent to which completing a continuous assessment project, applying research, may impact on student skill development and learning. Links are made to social constructivism and the impact on learning. The research methodology used is a quantitative approach involving an online survey of students who have engaged in the module. Ethical considerations were carefully applied including informed consent, confidentiality and anonymity. The findings highlight the participant's view of the impact of the research project on their knowledge and skill development. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={In this paper, we analyze the cognitive-linguistic skills (description, explanation, justification and argument) of 5 students in a technological course, Management of Agribusiness Production Program at the Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, in collaboration with Edupol. The study is set at an online course with convergent media, where students analyze industrial processes related to industrial chemistry. The methodology is qualitative with case study; the results show that the cognitive-linguistic skills of students, synchronously and asynchronously, can be enhanced by developing content and social writing through a dialogic communication, and creating a learning environment based on the principles of constructivism in online education. © Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

abstract={Constructivist learning posits that learners should construct their own meaning and organization of knowledge through exploration. Web-based distributed interactive learning (DIL) environments are a type of information and communications technology that supports learners in exploring learning materials. Although educators can access learners’ navigational paths on DIL websites, the exploratory nature of such paths cannot be efficiently analyzed. Educators cannot determine the effects of small improvements or adjustments on DIL websites. In this study, the navigational paths of learners using alternative versions of a DIL website were recorded and analyzed using integrated sequence analysis methods. Visualization and clustering of the sequences revealed five common navigational patterns, and associations between the navigational patterns and learning outcomes were also identified. The findings show how educators can understand and improve the design of DIL websites by performing a sequence analysis. © 2018, Grand Canyon University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the advancement of digital technology, software and applications are overwhelmingly accessible to teachers and students. Digital designs for teaching and learning are highly encouraged by scholars as they prepare students of today for the demands of the future workforce. Thus, many educators use available social networks for their classrooms. However, the use of social networks in education presents disadvantages, as their invention is geared toward social networking purposes. Therefore, it’s important to ask whether social learning platforms, such as Edmodo, provide a better alternative. The research aims to elucidate strategies for and advantages of executing Edmodo in education. The research employs purposive sampling, which led to sample of a total of four undergraduates from a prestigious Malaysian university. The research frameworks are on the theories of constructivism, hermeneutics, symbolic interactionism, and interpretivism, which focus on the process of meaning making and one’s interpretation of a phenomenon. It aims to generate insights and sharing through in-depth interviews using interview protocol, photographs, and concept maps. The study executes open coding to identify emerging themes; axial coding, which focuses on finding the themes’ consistency; and selective coding, whereby core categories are selected in order to illuminate Edmodo’s effects. The findings are presented in a narrative manner. The pedagogical implications pertain to how Edmodo breaks barriers by enabling students to access learning resources beyond the classroom and empowering student-centered learning through novelty of tasks, suitable learning environment, and mobility. © 2018, The Online Learning Consortium.

abstract={Constant evolution of game engines and the growing maturity of Game Based Learning have broadened the benefits of virtual worlds and augmented the value of exploratory and experiential learning, in the educational process. Virtual worlds act as a ludic environment for students, create new opportunities and offer alternatives to traditional, literal study. They introduce interactivity and playfulness in the learning process which acts as an essential trigger for students. According to Discovery Learning, a technique based on constructivism, the unconstrained exploration and navigation within virtual worlds is fundamental for the learning process. In this context, we developed an interactive educational game, henceforth ThimelEdu, using the Unity game engine, the Blender 3D creation suite and the IOLAOS Cloud Ecosystem. ThimelEdu attempts to create a pragmatic virtual word to act as a complementary tool to ancient theatre studies. In this pursuit, 3D artefacts that represent constructional components of an ancient theatre, were implemented based on bibliographic references, reconstructing a virtual historical site. The 3D artefacts are interactive and incorporate information that can be retrieved by learners as part of an explorative learning experience. Thus, knowledge is concealed within the interactive artefacts of the virtual world and can be discovered during the virtual expedition. The learning process is established and assessed through online interactive quizzes and questionnaires while exploring the ThimelEdu’s virtual word. Most importantly, learners can perform knowledge assessment based on virtual artefacts interaction, in-game quizzes and questionnaires without the intervention of teachers. Game personalization is achieved through the IOALOS’s user profiling module that automatically customizes game during game login according to player’s profile. Furthermore, ThimelEdu provides ad-hoc real time game customization for better game experience, enhanced educational results and improved playfulness. © 2018, Dechema e.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The principles of constructivist educational theory have come to be central to e-learning practice (Nkonge and Gueldenzoph 2006). Constructivist thought on e-pedagogy has provided basic principles of constructivism learning theory (Doolittle 1999; Hein 1991) for e-teaching best practices (Alley and Jansak 2001; Hacker and Niederhauser 2000; Keeton 2004). E-practice focused on learning and teaching processes is based on operational policies and practice standards for virtual learning environments (Kala et al. 2010). According to the evidence, practice which is based on learning and teaching theories can support online learning courses by developing a model for the learning and teaching process (Oliver 2001; Thurmond 2002). © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={This paper outlines proposed doctoral research into how postgraduate students develop academic literacies within the bounds of learning theories and Web 2.0 tools that their lecturers select. Lea and Street's (1998) academic literacies approach, which views literacies as contested social practices, forms the overarching view of literacy in this research. Over one semester, multiple case studies of postgraduate students will be conducted as they complete a paper within their subject of study. Students will use a private Facebook community to complete learning tasks and engage in student initiated discussions. The learning tasks will provide opportunities to examine the student experience of both the constructivist and connectivist paradigms. The aim is to further understanding of the student experience that can inform the creation of sound, theory driven Web 2.0-based learning tasks that effectively assist students in the development of their academic literacies. Feedback on the proposed research is sought from the Ascilite community. © ASCILITE 2015 - Australasian Society for Computers in Learning and Tertiary Education, Conference Proceedings.All right reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, the author made a study on College English teaching achievement evaluation based on MOOC. Under the guidance of constructivism, this paper built an O2 O English Teaching Platform based on the MOOC with the focus on learning database construction for the non-English major students in colleges. Combining with the English O2 O Platform and Flipped Class Model, this paper built an English Teaching Model and verified the validity and feasibility of it. The platform was divided into three roles including learners, teachers, and mentors from the angle of the user, which focused on study and online autonomous learning function. This paper applied O2O Teaching Model for the teaching experiment. The experimental results showed that there was a significant difference between the scores of experimental class and control class, which proved the validity and feasibility of O2 O Teaching Model, and O2 O Teaching Model would help to enhance the students' learning enthusiasm and improve their English practical ability if it is applied in English teaching properly. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

abstract={Classroom instruction in the 21st century needs to incorporate innovative, research-based pedagogies. The engineering classroom is currently experiencing a shift towards more active learning activities due to both advances in educational research, and advances in technologies that enable practices such as the flipped classroom model. Given that course transformation is a gradual process that begins at the level of the instructor, educators need access to the essential tools and training in order to introduce these changes into the curricula. This paper introduces a course re-design based on Self-Determination Theory and Constructivism; and outlines effectively implemented active learning strategies using the flipped classroom model. The data were collected from a Numerical Analysis course, which is an important course across several engineering disciplines at Universidad EAFIT. This course enables engineering students to solve complex problems using mathematical and computational methods. This paper describes the implementation of an online active learning platform called "Numérico Interactivo" for two related engineering courses: Numerical Analysis (NA) and Numerical Processes (NP). The platform was available to all students, but only NA implemented it using a flipped classroom model. NP made the platform available as an optional course tool. Informed by SDT principles, "Numérico Interactivo" includes a variety of instructional materials such as explanations, examples, frequently asked questions (FAQ), self-assessment tools, and evaluation. This study compares the two courses in terms of: (1) students' perceptions about the instructional materials of the course; (2) students' use of the platform; and (3) students' perceived usefulness of the different elements within the platform. Results suggest that students in the NA course found the classroom sessions and the homework assignments more useful as compared to the students enrolled in the NP course. In addition, in the NA course students used the platform more often for class preparation and to study before each module. The way in which the platform was implemented in NA also increased student motivation in the course. Overall, the results suggest that "Numérico Interactivo" is useful to implement course re-designs into engineering and computing education courses, but such tools need to be guided by active learning practices so that students can fully benefit from them. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Flipping the classroom is a pedagogical approach which links classroom learning activities and personal learning outside the classroom. The use of online learning for personal learning. This research aimed to develop a LMS which responds to constructive learning, termed as SCOCIALClassnet. This serves as a simple tool for creating the online learning environment for flipping the classroom. This study investigated the satisfaction of 30 teachers in the basic education level and 10 experts in online technology and education on the use of SCOCIALClassnet. The study indicated that the teachers and experts were very satisfied; especially, they were highly satisfied with elements of the LMS which respond to the instructional design that focuses on knowledge construction with the ease of use. What should be developed further is the user interface to better serve users and learning analytic modules. The findings in this study serve as the foundation for developing an LMS that responds to cognitive learning for the classroom. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, the usability of a social constructivist online teacher preparation course was examined using a framework developed for asynchronous constructivist courses. In particular, students’ approaches to learning through interactivity were examined. Students from around the world participated in the course. Data from weekly feedback were analyzed using phenomenography, a qualitative research approach that examined data from the student perspective and the descriptions of the students’ experiences. The findings from the weekly feedback analysis identified three qualitatively distinct types of interactivity: group work, synchronous meetings, and interpersonal interactions in the learning management system. Variation existed in students’ approaches to learning in these three types of interaction. Considerations for course designers are discussed at the conclusion of the analysis. © 2017, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.},

abstract={The process of learning and teaching online learning has undergone many changes in line with technological developments. Education institutions have begun introducing new methods of learning this. However, it needs a huge amount of labor intensive to produce and maintain educational technologies due to its huge size (literacy, vocational education, school education, engineering and medical education) and huge variants (language, dialect). With the growing demand and at the same time would like to reduce the factor of cost, time and effort is long, then the need for an effective solution allowing rapid system development. A Software Product Line (SPL) approach is one of the best methods that can be used to develop an educational software family. The research contributes to the development of online learning SPL by studying issues in online learning SPL, identify appropriate pedagogical approach to online learning environment that is constructivism, and designing constructivist learning environment based on the theory of constructivism and design principles. In this paper, comparison between 10 VLE was tabulated against constructivist learning environment. The comparative evaluation is to discover commonalities and variabilities between online learning applications. The results should be useful as the process of domain analysis that is to document the commonalities and variabilities between SPL members. Hence, it can be used to enhance the feature model for online learning applications. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports a new strategy for ICT-enhanced learning targeting at the global awareness issues for bridging the gap between the university and the society at the global level. While defining the key points for the global education, it is proposed that there should be a need for the learning environment to nurture the problem-solving skills in teams consisting of global students to tackle with the issues in the global society. The proposed courses here are based on the pilot study courses to set a benchmark as well as on a series of discussions between Kansai University and ASEAN universities, especially, universities in Taiwan and Malaysian Putra University. These courses focus on Communication to Build Trust through Empathy in the Society and Social Entrepreneurship, e-Culture & e-Agriculture. These courses make a heavy use of the state-of-the-art ICT and rich media Technology. It is planned that the courses will be fully launched in the fall semester of the academic year 2017 among the allied universities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The new guidelines for science education emphasize the need to introduce computers and digital technologies as a means of enabling visualization and data collection and analysis. This requires science teachers to bring advanced technologies into the classroom and use them wisely. Hence, the goal of this study was twofold: to examine the application of web-based technologies in science teacher preparation courses and to examine pre-service teachers’ perceptions of “cloud pedagogy”—an instructional framework that applies technologies for the promotion of social constructivist learning. The study included university teachers (N = 48) and pre-service science teachers (N = 73). Data were collected from an online survey, written reflections, and interviews. The findings indicated that university teachers use technologies mainly for information management and the distribution of learning materials and less for applying social constructivist pedagogy. University teachers expect their students (i.e., pre-service science teachers) to use digital tools in their future classroom to a greater extent than they themselves do. The findings also indicated that the “cloud pedagogy” was perceived as an appropriate instructional framework for contemporary science education. The application of the cloud pedagogy fosters four attributes: the ability to adapt to frequent changes and uncertain situations, the ability to collaborate and communicate in decentralized environments, the ability to generate data and manage it, and the ability to explore new venous. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The development of computer-based experiment set has become necessary in teaching physics in schools so that students can learn from their real experiences. The purpose of this study is to create and to develop the computer-based experiment set on simple harmonic motion of mass on springs for teaching and learning physics. The average period of oscillation, the displacement-time, the velocity-time and the acceleration-time are relevant to the theory. Based on Constructivism Approach, 96 upper secondary students were tested on this computer-based experiment set. The satisfaction of the samples to their learning activities is at a high level and their pretest and post-test scores are 9.22 and 73.80 % respectively. With the developed experiment set, learners will have an easier way to study the simple harmonic motion of a hanging mass on spring and an easier way to measure the position of an oscillating mass as a function of time. Thus, learners would get their physics concept more precisely and more quickly than ever. Learners’ laboratory skills are promoted both inside and outside classrooms. Physics teachers are able to construct experiment sets on their own with low cost, and this experiment set will certainly benefit their physics teaching. © 2017, The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={The paradigm of education has been changed around the globe because of the recent development of smart technology. Thanks to these changes, various web-based course management systems or instructional approaches have been integrated into classroom learning and teaching in order to inspire the study of digital native young generation. This study investigates university students’ learning experiences in using Moodle as the online learning management system which is intended to facilitate flipped learning procedures within the context of English as a foreign language (EFL). Moodle is a web-based learning management system with pedagogical approaches based on constructivism, which emphasizes the roles of shared learning communities, learner-centeredness, and social interaction in the learning context. Flipped learning has been introduced as an effective instructional method which can supplement conventional teacher-centered instruction and help to promote learner-centered learning milieu in language classrooms. Along with the use of Moodle as the learning management system, adopting flipped learning as an effective instructional strategy can accomplish the pedagogical paradigm of constructivism. This paper examines a variety of issues about adopting Moodle as an online learning management system and implementing flipped learning in EFL education. This study also scrutinizes how integrating Moodle into flipped classrooms has improved students’ English language learning and classroom interaction. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={This research paper addresses how academics can engage the Net Generation using YouTube in Higher Education to enhance learning. This explanatory research focuses on user behavior of both Academics and students via interviews and questionnaires. An interpretive constructivism approach examines how academics use YouTube to engage students in the classroom, as well as understanding the learning needs of undergraduate students as relating to video-based interventions. The data collection and analysis employs online questionnaires and semi-formal interview tools in a cross sectional time frame. Results show that students engage emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally when academics deploy YouTube into the classroom. A possible limitation of the research is that all participants in the questionnaires are second year Accounting undergraduate students in the Commerce faculty at the University of Cape Town. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={There is hype in the use of technology for teaching and learning. Online learning groups have been preferred and advocated for increasing learning. However, developing technology supported teaching and learning require user centered approaches to ensure that the design solutions meet users' needs. Since the research is situated within a practice area of online learning groups, pragmatism and social constructivism will inform this study. In this paper, pragmatism and social constructivism philosophy is discussed. The non-consequentialist philosophical ethical approach and how it relates to this research field is also analyzed. The paper argues that non-consequentialist philosophical ethical approach is the most appropriate in researching online learning groups. This will be done through elaborating on our research methodology aimed at analyzing and supporting online learning groups. This case will guide the discussion in the philosophical and ethical concerns in the area of online learning groups. We conclude that pragmatism, social constructivism and non-consequentialism theoretical lenses can offer possibilities for ethically researching online learning groups. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aimed to design a model for blended learning based on cloud classroom. Central China Normal University carried out the instructional strategy of blended learning which based on could classroom, but many teachers find it difficult to design the blended learning model. To solve this problem, a blended learning model based on cloud classroom was built under the basic theory of constructivism and the design principles of blended learning. The model combined face-to-face teaching with online teaching, and made the curriculum interaction consistent. The model constructed in the research in order to have a positive influence on both teachers' perceptions and students' usage of cloud classroom. Finally, through the interview investigation, we found that blended learning improved students' performance but would increase the teachers' workload in some extent. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The essence of this chapter is to discuss theories and practices including approaches that instructional designers consider when designing Web-based instruction for adult learners. The importance of the chapter is to discuss best practice activities and theories as well as technologies that enable adult online learners to be involved in the design of their Web-based instruction. This represents recognition that adults have accumulated a repertoire of knowledge and experiences that inevitably will enrich the course materials. The theories discussed in this chapter are constructivism and connectivism; these theories improve adult involvement and help them to establish learning networks for exchanges of ideas using cultural artifacts and various interactive and video technologies. These technologies include Adobe Connect, Camtasia, Articulate Storyline, SoftChalk, Prezi, Google.docs, and Google Hangout. The idea is to provide rich virtual learning environments to help adult learners explore learning and connect with each other without inhibition. The traditional method of instruction, which is teacher-centered, is considered inadequate for the present digital age with its rapid knowledge transformation. The roles of technology leaders within the institutional leadership and factors that may impact negatively on Webbased instruction for adults are also considered. © 2018 by IGI Global.

abstract={Literature suggests that existing learning management systems should be extended to integrate learning activities that aim at enhancing comprehension of students in Computer Science education. Therefore, literature has proposed Computing Augmented Learning Management System (CALMS) that meets the needs of online Computer Science education. However, it’s unclear the current state of architecture for the CALMS to assist researchers interrogate and extend its modules for online Computer Science education. Pedagogically to ascertain the thinking direction of current Computer Science educators it’s also relevant to understand philosophical stance of learning events from the new idea of CALMS for online computer science education. The review reveals that learning events of the CALMS suggest an adaption of moderate constructivism stance for online Computer Science education. The CALMS incorporate annotations, algorithm or animation visualization and automatic assessment for the purposes of computer science education. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Changes in our global world have shifted the skill demands from acquisition of structured knowledge to mastery of skills, often referred to as twenty-first century competencies. Given these changes, a sequential explanatory mixed methods study was undertaken to (a) examine predominant instructional methods and technologies used by teacher educators, (b) identify attributes for learning and teaching in the twenty-first century, and (c) develop a pedagogical framework for promoting meaningful usage of advanced technologies. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via an online survey, personal interviews, and written reflections with science teacher educators and student teachers. Findings indicated that teacher educators do not provide sufficient models for the promotion of reform-based practice via web 2.0 environments, such as Wikis, blogs, social networks, or other cloud technologies. Findings also indicated four attributes for teaching and learning in the twenty-first century: (a) adapting to frequent changes and uncertain situations, (b) collaborating and communicating in decentralized environments, (c) generating data and managing information, and (d) releasing control by encouraging exploration. Guided by social constructivist paradigms and twenty-first century teaching attributes, this study suggests a pedagogical framework for fostering meaningful usage of advanced technologies in science teacher education courses. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The depth of learning resides in collaborative work with more engagement and fun. Technology can enhance collaboration with a higher level of convenience and cloud computing can facilitate this in a cost effective and scalable manner. However, to deploy a successful online learning environment, elementary components of learning pedagogy must be embedded in the technology framework. A cloud computing technology based learning platform built on the proven learning pedagogies will be most successful attempt to facilitate collaborative and convenient learning. Such platform will support the learners to connect and coordinate the online resources in a more efficient, effective and practical way. This paper proposes a new theoretical framework for collaborative and convenient learning on cloud computing technology by reviewing various learning theories and integrating them with the technology framework. Architectural details of the framework have been presented with suitable examples for a better understanding. The work has a lot of significance for deploying cloud computing based collaborative learning solutions in the educational institutions. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={If many are still skeptical about the contribution of virtual environments in the learning process, others are still debating on the significant differences between traditional and online education. In other words, information and communication technologies are yet to be viewed as the indispensable pedagogical and learning tool, enabling meta-cognitive development and autonomous learning. Virtual environments as well as learning strategies are implemented in order to guide online learners in achieving their objectives. However, it was found that there is a lack of cognitive interactions. Therefore, this research's aim is to assess the gaps between the desired learning type of interactions and the actual learning activities of the learners. As methodology, a questionnaire was designed to identify synchronous interactions, done both individually and in teams. The participants in the survey are eighteen online learners, enrolled in a completely online master's course in France. With the help of activity theory the existing system is assessed and most of the learners claim that they go through the prescribed learning activities. The type of interactions obtained after compilation of the questionnaire refers to learner-tools, learner-content, tutor-learner as well as learner-learners interactions. Considering the shortcomings, improved processes are proposed which promote quality interactions among actors. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is so great and growing significantly in teaching and learning of this 21st Century. The flipped classroom model has grown in popularity as it is the only blended learning model that utilized both in class time and out of class time. There is a need to evaluate the quality of the best flipped learning approach that could enhance students' ICT skills as mastering ICT skill is becoming the key of learning in this 21st century. The ability to educate students for higher order learning using technology does enhance the learning processes as compared to the traditional settings. There are only a few studies conducted on the students taking ICT subject and none have in depth studies in their ICT skills. Therefore, this paper proposed a new flipped classroom model that increases students' ICT skills. The model incorporates the Social Constructivism theory and Flipped Classroom Model that are derived from blended learning. There are also two learning strategies used in this model which is Competency-based Learning and Inquiry-based Learning which helps to enhance students' ICT Problem Solving Skill. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the characteristics and behaviour of learners on nine Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the FutureLearn platform in 2014 and 2015. FutureLearn's social constructivist approach, which emphasizes learning through social interaction, makes the focus on forum posting within these MOOCs particularly appropriate. This study makes a significant contribution to the research on MOOCs by exploring first the extent to which learners on FutureLearn MOOCs make comments, second, whether groups of learners who comment to a lesser or greater extent have different demographic characteristics and third, whether commenting activity is associated with MOOC completion. The study uses a large dataset of over 25 000 learners to examine learners who comment versus those who do not, and learners who generate many posts. The results show that learners who are older, work part-time or not at all are more likely to post a comment, and those who are older, work part-time or not at all, are better educated and have prior online experience make the most comments. Making comments is also strongly associated with completing a MOOC, in particular for those who make many comments. Lay Description: What is already known about this subject matter? MOOCs have low completion rates. There are different types of MOOCs with different pedagogical approaches. FutureLearn MOOCs have a social constructivist approach and provide discussion areas to encourage social interaction. MOOC learners have different commenting behaviours. What this paper adds? A consideration of the extent to which the FutureLearn approach is successful in its encouragement of social interaction. A better understanding of which learners make comments. A large-scale study of the relationship between commenting and completion of MOOCs. Implications for practitioners Commenting and completing seem to be related. Older, educated learners who have done an online course previously, who have spare time tend to comment and complete more. A recognition that some types of learners engage with MOOCs in a less socially interactive way. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: This paper analyzes critically four selected learning theories and their role in online instruction for adults. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted to analyze the theories. Findings: The theory comparison revealed that no single theory encompasses the entirety of online instruction for adult learning; each theory explains some portion of adult online learning; theories are contextual; and components of all theories can be utilized to improve online learning. Research limitations/implications: Adult learning theories and their roles in shaping online learning and instruction deserve more attention. The study of adult learning theories, combined with in-depth analysis of psychological and human resource literature, will enable researchers to delve deeper into the subject. More qualitative studies are needed to explore further how instructors’ ability to utilize theoretical principles can improve online learning. Practical implications: This manuscript offers practical advice to instructors and other practitioners for utilizing adult learning theories for instructional enhancement.

abstract={There is currently strong and widespread support among university administrators for blended learning at the college level, or courses that incorporate some degree of online instruction. As instructors are called on to incorporate online and face-to-face elements into their instruction, they face the critical question of how to intentionally connect the two modalities in ways that strengthen learning. This article first outlines the historical context of social-constructivism’s presence in online instruction, and then presents a rationale for the use of “crossover” discussion protocols that connect online forums and face-to-face discussions. The article argues that by drawing deliberately on the benefits of both online and in-person learning environments, crossover protocols help students make more insightful connections among ideas and push their own—and each others’— thinking in unexpected ways. A set of crossover protocols is then provided, along with considerations for implementing them effectively. These practical strategies for facilitating conversations across the two modalities were developed in the author’s undergraduate and graduate level courses in English and education and are adaptable across course levels and disciplines. The article concludes with a discussion of how students experience the learning benefits of crossover protocols. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship education is observed as expanding in both academic and informal settings. Drawing on the Business Schools paradigm, relevant courses deliver contiguous knowledge and competencies applicable to new business creation based on cognitive and experiential instruction. Germane studies explore the entrepreneurial intention of trainees as a consequence of the pursued instruction. This chapter follows a more student-centric perspective which supposes the underlying cognitive schemes of trainees and their evolution as primordial structures that are affected through learning. This focus turns the approach into pure constructivism where the Piagetian concepts of assimilation and accommodation underpin learning. Based on a coherent constructivist online environment, that is the TeleCC platform in Greece, evidence for reflection, critical thinking and meta-learning incidents is investigated amongst the trainees’ dialogues and comments. The appearance of these processes verifies the dynamics of constructivist learning and Piaget’s equilibration process. There has been minimal attention in research so far into genuine constructivist signatures relevant to entrepreneurial learning; a gap that motivated the research of this chapter. The features of the learning environment and the facilitating role for the educator are crucial presuppositions for deep constructivist learning processes to occur. Else, instructional interventions favour the customary guidance and knowledge or experience transfer. It is maintained that the constructivist approach is an underdeveloped yet innovative perspective for educational research in entrepreneurship that needs good examples and contextualisation of relevant concepts and processes. Its contribution will be especially important and inclusive for the lifelong learning domain where adult learners participate in with repositories of personal life experiences and crystallised and resistant conceptualisations for the phenomena under consideration. © 2017 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The emergence of social media over the past decade has influenced the growth of learning environments, especially in connectivist MOOCs. Considerable research and development efforts have also focused on creating technologies that promote learning within a social network environment. Thus, researchers are currently investigating learning environments that are more open and networked, while the underlining learning theory is moving from social constructivism to connectivism. Currently, there are relatively few studies that addresses the use of social media in MOOCs. To build further understanding, the aim of this paper is to bring together literature on the uses of social media in MOOCs, its impacts and challenges and recommendations. The findings shows that: (1) Social media tools have the potential to become one of the strengths of MOOCs because they enhance interaction, the exchange of ideas, build personal learning networks, motivate students, and increase retention; (2) In some MOOCs, social media usage failed to promote learner-learner interactions because learner-instructor interactions were more dominant; (3) There are also challenges incorporating social media in MOOCs. This review will provide future designers of MOOCs with a deeper understanding of the current issues in the use of social media in MOOCs, and information on effective ways of using social media to promote interactions and retention. It also recommends future work.},

abstract={The wide adoption of social media has encouraged university teachers to consider employing social media as a new e-learning platform. This research aims to find the role of social media usage in promoting effective communication and enhancing group task performance. What is more, to give implications on a better grouping method, we utilized the concept of tie strength (in a typical social network) in the current research. We proposed that the tie strength among university students negatively moderates the relationship between social media usage and communication. The social constructivism theory was employed as a major theoretical foundation, built on which a research model was developed. The model was tested via 135 senior-year undergraduates in one of the diversified classes. The data analysis results revealed that social media usage promotes communication in group; tie strength in the social network group negatively influences group communication. This means, contrary to our natural assumption, the closer the relationship is among group members, the less likely communication would happen in the group. Our research gave implications on pedagogy in that it extended our understanding of the project-based learning in small teams supported by interactions via social media. It also contributed to the grouping strategies of the classes that rely heavily on the group discussion via social media. © 2017 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

abstract={Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is used a framework for supporting online and blended learning in educations. Online communication and collaboration are fostered by prior face-to-face social contact (Dau, 2015). Correspondingly, social collaboration is to a significant extent based on the establishment of direct eye contact (Khalid, Deska and Hugenberg, 2016), but direct eye contact is challenged by the position of the digital devices and thus CSCL. Lack of eye contact is the chief contributor to the negative effects of online disinhibition (Lapidot-Lefler and Barak, 2012) and the problem is the location of the web camera on the computer. Eye contact is challenged by the displacement between the senders' and receivers' focus on the screen picture and the camera's location at the top or bottom of screens on all digital devices. The aim of this paper is accordingly to investigate the influence of the displacement in eye contact using CSCL. The research question address the impact of the displacement of eye contact in the collaborative problem-solving process and the consequences for the design of a CSCL environment. Based on the epistemology of social constructivism and the theory of communities of practice, the paper adds a theoretical framework for the investigation made. The research method is based on the principles of interaction design. Lecturers and students from graphic design technology, computer science, software development and web-development are included in the study. The study is part of the development of a cross-border digital commuting learning environment in the Baltic Sea Nordic countries. It is revealed that eye contact is essential for collaboration in the problem-solving process. Moreover, it is stressed that there is a need for adding new visual representations in computer supported collaboration. Based on the results, recommendations for prototyping and further research are suggested. © The Authors, 2017.},

abstract={Problem-solving (PS) is an ability that contribute in realigning and monitoring the thinking process thus believed to be able to enhance the quality of learning by promoting higher order thinking skill (HOTS) in students. Problem-solving helps to equip an individual to become competent thus, able to manage the modern challenges of the 21st century. Deviating towards technologyrich and fast-paced societies, Facebook has the potential to be utilised as a good alternative mediator in engaging students with online learning. The integration of an engaging ill-defined 'case' to anchor students' interest, complementing it with metacognitive scaffolding (MS) within students' preferred social media platform, is expected to attain an optimist online PS discussion activities. In agreement with Social Constructivism theory, this combination offers active interaction and collaboration, which eventually AIDS in fostering PS and higher order thinking skill (HOTS). This proposed framework is not limited for use as a theoretical reference for research purposes, but can also be practiced by educators in fulfilling the aspiration of the Ministry of Education (MOE) to inculcate PS skill and generating HOTS among students. © Serials Publications.},

abstract={The rapid growth of technology has had a significant effect on educational activities. As a result of this growth, a shift has taken place from a behaviorist teaching style to a constructivist perspective which enables adult learners to build up knowledge collaboratively. Mentoring, a valuable tool within the constructivism approach, can offer a two-way knowledge-sharing environment in which participants can adopt what they learn into their workplaces through a process called transformative learning. Mentoring has now embraced technological advances so that participants can contact each other with synchronous and asynchronous communication tools such as Skype and e-mail respectively. This research project was conducted in a governmental company as a case study in order to study how the participants of mentoring understand their roles, and how they perceive these roles when communicating through Skype and e-mail. The project culminates in suggestions for a new e-mentoring model for practitioners. One of the findings in the research shows that the understanding of the mentoring relationship is diverse, and most participants have confusion about the different meanings of coaching, mentoring and consulting. However, almost all the participants agree that mentors should have a strong position to foster transformative learning in a mentoring process. Although transformative learning has not occurred in the relationships, Skype is a supporting technology for mentors to complement e-mail dialogs by clarification, and building up a trusting relationship. Moreover, some mentors often take an active role to manage and control the relationships as a leading position, but mentees mostly support this action by asking good questions and initiating meetings. Additionally, e-mail is used as a storage tool to review previous conversations, and it is used to re-schedule and initiate online meetings. Lastly, the researcher reflects on the implementation process as practical implications for other practitioners who would like to implement electronic mentoring in workplaces.},

abstract={Individual instruction is recognized as an effective learning method which is highly supported by the so-called personalized, intelligent or adaptive systems. The main purpose of this learning method is to offer customized content, experience or tools, based on the learning profile of students (learning style, gender, prior knowledge, learning goals and so on), so as to improve the learning outcomes. There are two wide-known adaption techniques implemented by learning systems to provide individual instruction: adaptability and adaptivity. The first one allows the students to take control, e.g. The learning system provides choices to let the students adapt the steps, sequences, difficulty level, preferences, while the second empowers the system, which is able to build a student model and to provide learning support based on that model. The current paper presents PoliCAT-A learning system based on Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) principle, which implements the second adaption technique (adaptivity) to provide individual instruction. Furthermore, the proposed web-based application supports the new learning paradigms, e.g. student-centered learning, communities of practice, and constructivism in general and relies on the current technologies-Web 2.0 and social Web, as students are able to share one's results on social media. The system is described as a useful tool for self-regulated learning, answering thus at the question whether assessment may have a strong formative role in learning or not. Besides highlighting the key features of the application, the paper provides experimental results from a web programming course for forth year students enrolled in an engineering degree program, who used the developed system as a learning tool during one semester. Students reported that they succeeded in strengthening their study skills and monitoring their academic progress through the learning analytics features. The available personalized feedback PoliCAT, as well as the possibility to share one's results in an e-community makes the instrument to be an attractive tool for today's social and cultural values of students, fact proven by the experiment as well.},

abstract={Much has been written about the theoretical potential of digital games to transform teaching and learning and to offer new forms of digital assessment; yet the education system in the United Kingdom (UK) is arguably still focused exclusively on the assessment and reward of individual effort and achievement. This can be at odds with the requirements of twenty-first century working environments and in the requirements for developing the personal employability characteristics of students. Engaging students in authentic collaborative project work that requires sophisticated and coordinated communication can present real challenges. Employers are demanding, as prerequisite, that graduates have highly developed communication and collaborative team working skills for opportunities in the digital industries such as Games Design, however Games Design students are often quite isolated in their personal industry related practice, working methods and their online lifestyles and lack the "soft skills" which would enable them to work successfully within a team. In this paper, the authors elaborate on how Hull School of Art and Design has attempted to address this problem through the implementation of an Applied Game, the "Watercooler Game", for their Games Industry undergraduates. They present their reflections on the rationale behind the pedagogic approach, the decision to develop an applied game to address their pedagogic challenges and their experience of working with a commercial Games Developer in producing the game. The authors present the initial findings of their evaluation of game from a multidimensional perspective. The pedagogic approach (using applied games with a selected small cohort of students), the technical approach adopted by the developers of the game (an open source asset based approach) and the pedagogic efficacy of the game through evaluation of the learning objectives achieved by a cohort of seventy learners situated in the College's School of Art and Design.},

abstract={Transitioning from a face-to-face teaching environment to online teaching requires a shift in paradigm by stakeholders involved (i.e., instructors and students). This chapter provides an extensive literature review to help novice online instructors understand the nature of online teaching presence to help position their students towards more active participation. Premised on the Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2000) and constructivism, we highlight a conceptual framework of four iterative processes for developing online teaching presence: preparations for facilitation, designing the facilitation, implementing the facilitation, and assessing the facilitation. Based on this framework, strategies are articulated for overcoming the challenges of online learning through shared stakeholder responsibility. © 2017 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Constructivism in education opposes the idea that all students learn in the same way and transfer of information by teacher will be enough for learning and argues that all individuals learn in their unique way and construct the new knowledge on previous knowledge and experiences. If so, results of teaching through constructivism will be different for every individual and subject. As a result, there are many studies in the literature examining the results and effectiveness of constructivist approach. The aim of this study is to present the tendency of studies selected by given criteria: i) consisting “constructivism”, “constructivist” or “constructive” word in its title, ii) available in ScienceDirect and Ebsco databases, iii) employed survey method and iv) carried out from 2005 to 2016 (until March). Snowball sampling will be used to find other studies starting from current ones and going through the past. Documentary analysis will be used as the method of the study while descriptive analysis in order to present the data as it is and content analysis in order to analyze the data deeply will be used as data analysis. As a result, readers will be able to current situation of studies related to constructivism. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={This paper describes the challenges of designing and implementing online group work. We are responsible for a seven-and-a-half week’s online literacy and bi-literacy graduate course in a Bilingual/English as a Second Language (BLE/ESL) Master of Arts program. One of the tasks includes online literacy circle exchanges where students are encouraged to create discourse as joint dialogues and make substantive and meaningful contributions to topics. We offer three figures that visualize types of interactions and exchanges representing potential behavioristic, social interdependence, and constructivism tendencies. We discuss both practical and theoretical concerns to elicit students’ engagement in a learning process, not just students’ interactions in completing a task. Online collaborative group work is discussed and developed through critical aspects of salient literature providing potential for innovative implementation and further contemplation within the profession and online communities of learners. © 2016, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.},

abstract={Electronic collaboration can provide the environments for educators and learners to connect electronically via the Internet to study together, communicate discuss, and to exchange information and resources from anywhere, anytime and in any place. However, despite the progress registered in the use of e-collaboration system as educational tools through the incorporation of constructivism learning theories and its related didactics in higher educational institution, the approach has not yet been successfully transferred to the classroom. More importantly, there are still misconceptions among researchers regarding students achieving authentic learning from online interaction and collaboration. In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed to assist in the design, development and implementation of e-collaboration in a higher education institution. The framework addresses the development process of e-collaboration content, approaches for e-collaboration, pedagogical didactics, learning theories, and roles of users in e-collaboration. In an attempt to validate the framework, an e-collaboration system named 'Teach, Learn, and Research E-collaboration System' (TELERECS), was developed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An experimental research design based on control and experimental groups, pre/post-test and usability survey were used to validate the framework. The results revealed that there is significant difference between the post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups. In addition, there is moderate, positive monotonic correlation between easy to use and post-test-scores; and between useful for team work and post-test-score for the experimental group. These imply that the framework offers a promising basis for meaningful learning. Future work includes a further exploration and validation of the framework and comparing results. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Sex and Gender Medicine is a novel discipline that provides equitable medical care for society and improves outcomes for both male and female patients. The integration of sex- and gender-specific knowledge into medical curricula is limited due to adequate learning material, systematic teacher training and an innovative communication strategy. We aimed at initiating an e-learning and knowledge-sharing platform for Sex and Gender Medicine, the eGender platform (http://egender.charite.de), to ensure that future doctors and health professionals will have adequate knowledge and communication skills on sex and gender differences in order to make informed decisions for their patients. Methods: The web-based eGender knowledge-sharing platform was designed to support the blended learning pedagogical teaching concept and follows the didactic concept of constructivism. Learning materials developed by Sex and Gender Medicine experts of seven universities have been used as the basis for the new learning tools. The content of these tools is patient-centered and provides add-on information on gender-sensitive aspects of diseases. The structural part of eGender was designed and developed using the open source e-learning platform Moodle. The eGender platform comprises an English and a German version of e-learning modules: one focusing on basic knowledge and seven on specific medical disciplines. Each module consists of several courses corresponding to a disease or symptom complex. Self-organized learning has to be managed by using different learning tools, e.g., texts and audiovisual material, tools for online communication and collaborative work. Results: More than 90 users from Europe registered for the eGender Medicine learning modules. The most frequently accessed module was "Gender Medicine - Basics" and the users favored discussion forums. These e-learning modules fulfill the quality criteria for higher education and are used within the elective Master Module "Gender Medicine - Basics" implemented into the accredited Master of Public Health at Charité - Berlin. Conclusions: The eGender platform is a flexible and user-friendly electronical knowledge-sharing platform providing evidence-based high-quality learning material used by a growing number of registered users. The eGender Medicine learning modules could be key in the reform of medical curricula to integrate Sex and Gender Medicine into the education of health professionals. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Constructionist principles provide fertile ground for developing innovative approaches to learning. Using a grounded theory qualitative research design, we analyzed participant reports of their experience in an online course in which they collaboratively authored a book. Our qualitative analysis suggested that participants experienced extraordinary engagement and motivation, which they interpreted as being related to the collaborative process, their own agency in the project, and the externalized value of creating an artifact intended for a public audience. A new metaphor for learning emerged from the study based on the concept of authorship. Our authorship learning construct sees learning as a process of authoring understanding and skills while simultaneously authoring at multiple levels of agency, including authorship of processes, roles, goals, artifacts, meaning, self, group identity, and society. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Objective To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a learner-created virtual patient (VP) curriculum for postgraduate year 2 surgical residents. Design Using a social-constructivist model of learning, we designed a learner-created VP curriculum to help postgraduate year 2 residents prepare for their in-training surgical examination. Each resident was assigned to create a VP curriculum based on the learning objectives for this examination, and VP cases were then disseminated to all residents for completion. To measure the learning effects of the curriculum, participants completed 2 simulated in-training examinations, both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Study participants also participated in a focus group and completed an online questionnaire about the perceived learning value of the curriculum. Setting The study was conducted at the McGill University Health Centre, a tertiary care hospital in Montreal, Canada. Participants In total, 24 residents from 7 surgical specialties completed both the pretest and posttest, as well as took part in the creation of a VP curriculum. Of those 24 residents, only 19 residents completed the cases created by their peers, with 7 completing greater than 50% of the cases and 12 completing less than 50%. In all 17 residents responded to the online questionnaire and 11 residents participated in the focus group. Results The VP curriculum failed to improve scores from pretest (59.6%, standard deviation = 8.1) to posttest (55.4%, standard deviation = 6.6; p = 0.01) on the simulated in-training examination. Nonetheless, survey results demonstrated that most residents felt that creating a VP case (89%) and completing cases created by their peers (71%) had educational value. Overall, 71% preferred active participation in a curriculum to traditional didactic teaching. The focus group identified time-related constraints, concern about the quality of the peer-created cases, and questioning of the relationship between the curriculum and the Surgical Foundations examination as barriers to the success of the curriculum. Conclusions Despite the fact that a learner-created VP curriculum did not improve scores on a mock in training examination, residents viewed this intervention as a valuable educational experience. Although there were barriers to the implementation of a learner-created curriculum, it is nonetheless important to try and integrate pedagogical concepts into the instructional design of curricula for surgical residents. © 2016 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

abstract={Among its many affordances, the interactive whiteboard (IWB) as a digital space for children's dialogic engagement in the Foundation Phase classroom remains largely under-exploited. This paper emanates from a study which was undertaken in an attempt to understand how teachers acquire knowledge of emerging technologies and how this shapes their classroom practices when employing technology as a pedagogic tool. The findings of this ethnographic case study show that, while teachers have become technically skilled through continuous professional teacher development (CPTD), they have also begun to reflect more rigorously on constructivism as a learning theory. Data was generated through semi-structured interviews and classroom observations with digital video recordings. Observations revealed a perceived gap in the use of the IWB as a promising space to generate reciprocal dialogue in classrooms to influence curriculum delivery and learning. This paper argues, therefore, that IWBs can become spaces for dialogic engagement to expand learners’ participation and higher order thinking skills through pedagogic strategies. Thus, there is a need to introduce Foundation Phase teachers to dialogic teaching methodologies and the potential impact thereof on learner engagement and learning. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework was developed by researchers interested in exploring learning in online discussions who grounded their thinking in social constructivist notions of inquiry-based teaching and learning. The i2Flex approach is similarly grounded in social constructivism and inquiry, thus it makes sense to explore the CoI framework with the hope of informing i2Flex models. The purpose of this chapter is to do so. The chapter summarizes the way the CoI framework is conceptualized as developing from the interaction of three presences, and reviews research on the effects of each presence on teaching and learning. The development and validation of a CoI survey and some of the research it has enabled is also discussed. In particular, the chapter examines a course redesign project that significantly improved learning outcomes in four online courses which seems ideally suited the ongoing development of i2Flex classes. The chapter concludes with an examination of two other frameworks for structuring blended learning that might be applicable to i2Flex classes. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A deep understanding of chemistry requires internal visualization of structures and processes at the molecular level to rationalize observable chemical and physical properties, and make sense of chemistry symbolism and mathematical relationships. The paper argues that accurate mental models of the molecular world are needed to address the student misconceptions described in the literature, and describes the potential and limitations of the VisChem animations to develop useful mental models. A constructivist learning design has been developed and evaluated as a best-practice strategy for effectively using the VisChem resources for learning. This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the Interactive Visualizations for Chemistry Teaching and Learning ACS CHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education online ConfChem held from May 8 to June 4, 2015. The lively discussions that followed addressed the difficulty of showing the crucial role of ion hydration without producing cognitive overload, the need to build a visual literacy through repeated and progressive use of molecular animations, and the complementary nature of animations and simulations to portray the molecular world. © 2016 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION: Knowledge transfer in pediatric rehabilitation is challenging and requires active, multifaceted strategies. The use of knowledge brokers (KBs) is one such strategy noted to promote clinician behavior change. The success of using KBs to transfer knowledge relies on their ability to adapt to ever-changing clinical contexts. In addition, with the rapid growth of online platforms as knowledge transfer forums, KBs must become effective in virtual environments. Although the role of KBs has been studied in various clinical contexts, their emerging role in specific online environments designed to support evidence-based behavior change has not yet been described. Our objective is to describe the roles of, and strategies used by, four KBs involved in a virtual community of practice to guide and inform future online KB interventions.
METHODS: A descriptive design guided this study and a thematic content analysis process was used to analyze online KB postings. The Promoting Action on Research in Health Sciences knowledge transfer framework and online andragogical learning theories assisted in the coding. A thematic map was created illustrating the links between KBs' strategies and emerging roles in the virtual environment.
RESULTS: We analyzed 95 posts and identified three roles: 1) context architect: promoting a respectful learning environment, 2) knowledge sharing promoter: building capacity, and 3) linkage creator: connecting research-to-practice. Strategies used by KBs reflected invitational, constructivism, and connectivism approaches, with roles and strategies changing over time.
DISCUSSION: This study increases our understanding of the actions of KBs in virtual contexts to foster uptake of research evidence in pediatric physiotherapy. Our results provide valuable information about the knowledge and skills required by individuals to fulfill this role in virtual environments.},

abstract={This paper examines the utility of an unobtrusive attention guidance functionality integrated into an anchored discussion system. Our proposed design is founded in social constructivism and accomplishes two objectives: (1) to promote students' task oriented reading of central domain principles from instructional materials, (2) to support students' progressive improvement of tentative ideas focusing on central domain principles from instructional materials. We perform experimental research to test our design and apply quantitative techniques to rigorously evaluate the utility of the developed attention guidance functionality. Results show that attention guidance prompted students to reflect on and monitor their cognitive processes while reading information they deemed important. Moreover, we found that students invested deliberate efforts to improve tentative ideas by focusing on information they deemed important. Finally, we discovered such efforts to be a significant predictor of task oriented reading of central domain principles from instructional materials. Theoretical and practical implications are outlined. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to explore the relationship between students' learning styles and their online participation in a blended learning course, and second, to investigate the relationships of students' online participation with their learning achievement and with course satisfaction. A total of 78 undergraduate students from a general education course called Digital Citizenship took part in the study. All the participants were required to participate in four different types of online activity: information access, interactive learning, networked learning and materials development. The study used the method of partial least squares to explore the relationships between different constructs. The results indicate that students' learning styles were significantly related to online participation and that online participation in networked learning and materials development was significantly related to their learning achievement and course satisfaction. This study highlights not only the crucial role of learning styles in online participation but also the importance of individual constructivism and social interaction for effective online learning. © 2014 British Educational Research Association.},

abstract={Here we review 18 articles that describe the design and evaluation of 1 or more games for diabetes from technical, methodological, and theoretical perspectives. We undertook searches covering the period 2010 to May 2015 in the ACM, IEEE, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, and Google Scholar online databases using the keywords "children," "computer games," "diabetes," "games," "type 1," and "type 2" in various Boolean combinations. The review sets out to establish, for future research, an understanding of the current landscape of digital games designed for children with diabetes. We briefly explored the use and impact of well-established learning theories in such games. The most frequently mentioned theoretical frameworks were social cognitive theory and social constructivism. Due to the limitations of the reported evaluation methodologies, little evidence was found to support the strong promise of games for diabetes. Furthermore, we could not establish a relation between design features and the game outcomes. We argue that an in-depth discussion about the extent to which learning theories could and should be manifested in the design decisions is required. © 2015 Diabetes Technology Society.},

abstract={Abstract: Three exemplars are presented of social technologies deployed in educational contexts: wikis; a photo-sharing environment; and a social bookmarking tool. Students were found to engage with the technologies selectively, sometimes rejecting them, in the light of their prior conceptions of education. Some students (a minority in all the studies) were unsympathetic to the educational philosophy underpinning the technology’s adoption. The paper demonstrates, through an examination of in-context use, the importance of sociocultural factors in relation to education, and the non-deterministic nature of educational technology. The academic study of technology has increasingly called into question the deterministic views which are so pervasive in popular discourse and among policy-makers. Instead, sociocultural factors play a crucial role in shaping and defining technology and educational technology is no exception, as the examples in the paper show. The paper concludes by drawing out some implications of the examples for the use of social technologies in education. © 2016 The Open University.},

abstract={This paper reports on the design and learning effects of an awareness mechanism integrated into an anchored discussion system. Drawing on social constructivist literature, the design aims to attract, retain, and if necessary reacquire students' attention on instructional materials' central principles in documentbased asynchronous online discussions. To form a holistic picture, we operationalized learning across three dependent variables: perceived learning, knowledge gain, and learning efficiency. We performed an experimental study (N=64) across two sections of a blended-format human-computer interaction course to evaluate our design. Results show that the proposed design increased students' perceptions of learning. However, the difference in knowledge gain scores was marginally significant, and represented a medium effect size. Interestingly, we found that our design afforded more efficient learning. Moreover, we discovered students' perceptions of learning to be a significant predictor of their learning efficiency. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.},

abstract={Collaborative Learning is the important key for constructivism learning because it is clarify knowledge of the learner. If collaborative learning is adapted with cloud technology, the learner would get more ideas. Thus, the objective of this research is to design the learning environment in constructivism learning which supports collaborative learning on cloud technology. This research methodology are synthesis designing framework, learning environment design, and pilot study. The result of the study was found that the design of learning environment based on constructivism with cloud technology consist of 1) problem situation 2) resource center 3) collaborative learning center 4) scaffolding 5) coaching. The evaluation of the collaborative learning with cloud technology found that the learner are encouraged to study with cloud technology (x = 4.52) regarding to online collaborative learning theory; Idea Generating (x 9 4.67), Idea Organizing (x = 4.40) and Intellectual Convergence (x 9 4.48).

abstract={Since the platform "Coursera" is created by the professors of Stanford University Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, more and more universities have joined in it. From the very beginning, online education is not only about education itself, but also connected with social equality. This is especially significant for the economic transformation in China. In this paper the research and practice on informatization of optical education are described. Online to offline (O2O) education activities, such as online learning and offline meeting, online homework and online to offline discussion, online tests and online to offline evaluation, are combined into our teaching model in the course of Applied Optics. These various O2O strategies were implemented respectively in the autumn-winter small class and the spring-summer middle class according to the constructivism and the idea of open education. We have developed optical education resources such as videos of lectures, light transmission or ray trace animations, online tests, etc. We also divide the learning procedure into 4 steps: First, instead of being given a course offline, students will learn the course online; Second, once a week or two weeks, students will have a discussion in their study groups; Third, students will submit their homework and study reports; Fourth, they will do online and offline tests. The online optical education resources have been shared in some universities in China, together with new challenges to teachers and students when facing the revolution in the e-learning future. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={Museums are places that can provide children with a vast and exciting world of information. However, constructivist learning theory suggests that static information displays are not the best way to help the children learn about the worlds being presented and that good learning outcomes occur when the learner directly interacts with, and reflects on, the subject material. In this research, the authors explored using new technologies to enable a constructivist learning environment for subject matter that children would not otherwise be able to interact with physically. We worked with a museum to construct a prototype interactive display to help children learn about the mangrove forest. Our evaluation of the prototype found that users were satisfied with the natural touch screen, the persistence of vision, media, storytelling, collaborative learning, and interactive artifacts. Issues included target age group, the shape of multi-Touch tabletop, and story type. The technology offered opportunities to provide constructivist learning and was engaging and intuitive.},

abstract={Asynchronous discussion is considered an effective and pervasive tool for engaging students to learn in an online or blended environment. Quality of asynchronous discussions in online learning platform has been suggested to associate with various design and learners characteristics, such as forum design in terms of embeddedness with background knowledge, social presence in group, type of discussion topics relating to higher-order thinking, cognitive strategies for eliciting discussion (e.g. debate, role-play), discussion group size, and intrinsic motivation to engage in asynchronous discussions. Design and facilitation in asynchronous discussions constitute two major determinants in the success of interaction among students in a discussion forum setting. Regarding issues pertaining to the design of asynchronous discussions, relatedness to real-life problems, rubrics and guidelines for discussion participation, and students' choice, are key components for conceptualizing effective construction of knowledge through discussion. While empirical evidence on effectiveness of asynchronous discussion in online learning suggested that choice and intrinsic motivation are critical to students' interaction and performance in discussion, the extent to which students' choices would moderate their effort and performance in participating discussions has received little attention and empirical investigation. The current study aims to explore role of students' interest and choice in asynchronous discussion in predicting their engagement and performance in the discussion process. With students' choice operationalized as their self-indicated preference for discussion topic, we examine the following research hypotheses: 1) Students' self-indicated preference for a specific topic among an array of topics available for asynchronous discussions would be associated with quantitative performance in the discussion process, in terms of the frequency of posts; and 2) Students' self-indicated preference for a specific topic among an array of topics available for asynchronous discussions would be associated with qualitative performance in the discussion process, in terms of the higher-order thinking artefacts exhibited in their posts. These research questions were tested with an observational design study with 707 students in a large undergraduate introductory psychology course in Hong Kong. Participating students engaged in a 3-week asynchronous discussion towards summative assessment via a centralized learning management system (LMS). Discussion behaviors were extracted from the LMS, while learning outcomes attainment was coded according to the structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy. Students' volition to participate, operationalized as their indicated preference for a specific topic out of an array of 8 available topics on the subject matter, correlated with their effort and performances in the discussion in terms of post frequencies, post length, and learning outcomes with reference to the SOLO taxonomy. Findings suggested that students' indicated preferences to commit to their discussion topics influenced their participation in the discussion in terms of both posting behaviors and level of learning outcomes. Impact on current findings for understanding students' autonomy and commitment in asynchronous discussion should be contextualized in a constructivist-learning environment.},

abstract={This paper replicates a previous study that used an active learning for knowledge construction in the e-learning model with three stages of underpinning, ownership, and engaging hypothesizing that the underpinning and ownership stages positively and significantly contribute to the engaging stage where the actual knowledge construction takes place. The findings of the present study have ensured the validity and the generalizability of the previous study results. Also, the findings reiterated the efficacy of the model for active learning for knowledge construction in e-learning. The paper concludes with implications and recommendations for future research.},

abstract={Making new meanings and relating them to existing knowledge and systems is at the heart of the constructivist approach to learning. Authentic learning builds on this by exploiting the power of information and communications technology (ICT) and is often delivered as a project based learning experience. Authentic learning aligns well with the 21st Century (21C) approach to teaching and learning which emphasises the development of key skills, such as problem solving, creativity and collaboration, along with the mastering of curriculum content. Against this backdrop this study seeks to explore a particular approach to technology mediated, authentic, project based, constructivist, 21C teaching and learning which uses the "Mantle of the Expert" pedagogy from drama education as a way of structuring an innovative learning experience. Mantle of the Expert learning explicitly uses role-play in which, within an imagined context, learners take on the role of experts within an enterprise and work together to solve a problem. The "Brain Game" is a model activity that immerses learners within an authentic context, collaborating with peers to manage a project within deadlines. Technology is a central element of the intervention as it provides a means for learners to engage in role-play through email, researching information online and producing deliverables. 144 students aged 13-14 from 11 schools participated in an exploratory case study involving two one-day workshops. The findings of the study suggest that a technology mediated approach was effective in developing students' 21C skills and that "Mantle of the Expert" is an appropriate pedagogy to use in designing authentic learning experiences.

abstract={The utility of students’ participation in panel discussion is an innovative way of interactive teaching learning activity which can be combined with any form of teaching methods to improve the quality of the teaching learning experience. The traditional didactic lectures are no longer accepted by the students. So new innovations in teaching methodology are needed to meet the requirements of the students. Panellists are chosen from the students by the students to create an in depth knowledge on the subject. The students are given learning modules prior to the session as well as clarifications and briefings by expert faculty. This method of self directed learning will make the teaching and learning process more interactive, effective and student friendly. © 2016, Global Research Online. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: The purpose of this study is to explore EFL (English as a Foreign Language) college students' perceptions and experiences about the technology-enhanced collaborative English writing course. Methods/Statistical Analysis: For the students' collaborative and interactive English learning experience, this study integrated the cloud-based online collaborative writing tool and the peer-editing activities in order to develop college students' English academic writing skills and motivation. Among various web-based collaborative writing platforms such as wikis, online word processors or blogs, Google Docs have been incorporated into the college EFL writing course for this study. Findings: Google Docs is a web-based free word processor and can be utilized as a tool of creating a web-based platform for submitting students' English essay writings and peer-editing. To find out students' perceptions and attitudes about technology-enhanced English writing instruction and online-based peer editing activities, cloud-based online survey was administered at the end of the course. For more in-depth analysis, students' essay samples and results from semi-structured focus group interview were utilized. In this study, using Google Doc, students could create online documents and edit them online while they were collaborating with other students and the instructor in real-time. This study indicated that students in the course demonstrated affirmative perceptions about the use of the cloud-based online writing tool and having collaborative peer-editing experience. Improvements/Applications: This study proposed that the application of Google Docs as the web-based collaborative writing platform helped to enhance active communication, autonomous class participation, mutual collaboration as well as dynamic classroom interaction.},

The introductory part of the paper analyzes their typical characteristics and their special, new-millennium style of learning and gaining knowledge. These skills, which are supported by leading contemporary paradigms (constructivism and connectivism), have provoked interesting changes in the theory and practice of education, but frequently neglected upbringing outcomes. This paper, based on the researched literature, examines possible influences of digital media on the formation of habits and creation of new patterns of behavior that are practiced in learning and everyday activities such as speed, multitasking, searching for information. It researches their immediate profitability and wide span of attention that results in lack of patience, perseverance, superficiality, thoughtlessness and physical and mental laziness. Although the new wave of Internet usage is being associated with positive educational qualities such as sharing, mutual help, support, honesty and tolerance, there are also some negative sides of it, specifically irresponsible and incorrect behavior towards others (electronic violence, disrespect for intellectual property), but also oneself (false self-presentation, (no) self-criticism and invasion of privacy). Since modern technology is forming the young generation and becoming an important force in shaping modern society, the conclusion emphasizes that with positive changes in the educational domain, attention should also be directed towards developing educational qualities such as perseverance, consistency, patience, criticism and self-criticism, responsible behavior, mutual respect and appreciation. It should be noted that, in the Croatian language, education and upbringing are different terms, which is why in the English version we used the terms education and upbringing separately. © 2016, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

In a sixteen-week period, a collaborative team including learning designers, teaching staff, education technologists and a graphic designer, devised and developed a gamified weekly activity for students featuring randomising and roleplay mechanics. Results indicated that the use of gamification improved students’ engagement with their class group and assisted them in learning key concepts. The considered and purpose driven use of gamification has proven to be a valuable tool in online learning. © 2016 Deakin University. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Worldwide web has evolved in the world. Traditional teaching which is instructing and learning in the classroom proceeding with face-to-face lectures is one of the most effective teaching methods. However, when combined with offline and online classroom lessons the greatest synergistic effect appears. The advantage of online learning is that self-directed learning is possible In other words, the quality of online content is very important. The percentage share of online video lecture content is showing explosive growth. Therefore, the importance of LMS (Learning Management System) technology to provide infrastructure for online classes is increasing. There are several online educational open source software in existence, but unlike the others, the Moodle LMS is based on the philosophy of social constructivism. However Moodle LMS is difficult to apply in real-time and fast-changing media technology. In this paper, it shows for a technology to play back the HD video format such as MP4 in a variety of devices, we tested open source video players based on HTML5 and JavaScript and then studied how to apply to Moodle LMS. To do this, we first developed standard guidelines to select a web video player for Moodle LMS. And then through the developed guidelines we selected an open-source video player and implemented it in the Moodle LMS. In particular, this study excluded non-standard Web technologies and was only conducted by standard Web technologies. As a result, a variety of devices became available for online educational support. For global education with non-wired internet infrastructure, Moodle LMS will be able to take advantage for a better way. © 2016 International Information Institute.},

abstract={Background There is rapidly increasing pressure to employ social media in medical education, but a review of the literature demonstrates that its value and role are uncertain. Objective To determine if medical educators have a conceptual framework that informs their use of social media and whether this framework can be mapped to learning theory. Methods Thirty-six participants engaged in an iterative, consensus building process that identified their conceptual framework and determined if it aligned with one or more learning theories. Results The results show that the use of social media by the participants could be traced to two dominant theories—Connectivism and Constructivism. They also suggest that many medical educators may not be fully informed of these theories. Conclusions Medical educators’ use of social media can be traced to learning theories, but these theories may not be explicitly utilised in instructional design. It is recommended that formal education (faculty development) around learning theory would further enhance the use of social media in medical education. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

There has been little discussion regarding flipping the classroom with students who are less academically prepared, specifically those students at open-enrollment colleges. Students at an open-enrollment college differed in their perceptions of the flipped classroom from those perceptions reported by instructors in advanced placement high school chemistry classes or chemistry at competitive colleges and universities. The focus of this paper is to provide readers with insights about flipping a general chemistry class at an open-enrollment college. This study compared high school class rank and mathematics placement level to overall course grades in two different iterations of the flipped classroom and lecture learning environments. The results of the ANOVA indicated that mathematics level explained 17.6% of the variance in course grade (R2 = 0.176, F(1,84) = 17.131, p < 0.001) and class rank explained 20.965% of the variance in course grade (R2 = 0.208, F(1,84) = 20.965, p < 0.001). Students who are less academically and mathematically prepared should have a very structured learning environment with continual instructor feedback and prescribed preclass activities. This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the ConfChem online conference Flipped Classroom, held from May 9 to June 12, 2014 and hosted by the ACS DivCHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education (CCCE). © 2015 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

abstract={Learning theories lay at the core of every educational paradigm; especially applicable to MOOCs are the ones that originate in constructivism. Connectivism is a de facto learning theory that is framing the growing enthusiasm surrounding the design and the worldwide dissemination of MOOCs. This chapter shows how connectivism has become the digital age's natural successor to the stream of learning theories that preceded it, despite its questionable ability to fulfill the totality of pre-digital requirements drafted for learning theories. As a disruptive phenomenon, several obstacles to materializing the promise of inclusiveness and equality in access to learning that is signified by MOOCs remain, including learner autonomy, presence (cognitive, social and teacher's) and critical literacies, as well as recognition, validation and accreditation. Finally, fostering the widespread development of the set of educatorś skills essential to fully implement connectivism is needed in order to fully reap the potential benefits of MOOCs. © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={The essence of this chapter is to discuss theories and practices including approaches that instructional designers consider when designing Web-based instruction for adult learners. The importance of the chapter is to discuss best practice activities and theories as well as technologies that enable adult online learners to be involved in the design of their Web-based instruction. This represents recognition that adults have accumulated a repertoire of knowledge and experiences that inevitably will enrich the course materials. The theories discussed in this chapter are constructivism and connectivism; these theories improve adult involvement and help them to establish learning networks for exchanges of ideas using cultural artifacts and various interactive and video technologies. These technologies include Adobe Connect, Camtasia, Articulate Storyline, SoftChalk, Prezi, Google.docs, and Google Hangout. The idea is to provide rich virtual learning environments to help adult learners explore learning and connect with each other without inhibition. The traditional method of instruction, which is teacher-centered, is considered inadequate for the present digital age with its rapid knowledge transformation. The roles of technology leaders within the institutional leadership and factors that may impact negatively on Webbased instruction for adults are also considered. © 2016, IGI Global.

abstract={Instructional Design for Teachers, Second Edition focuses on the instructional design (ID) process specifically for K-12 teachers. The first edition introduced a new, common-sense model of instructional design to take K-12 teachers through the ID process step by step, with a special emphasis on preparing, motivating, and encouraging new and ongoing use of ID principles. This second edition includes new material on design in gaming, cybercharters, online classrooms, and flipped classrooms, as well as special considerations for the Common Core. Each chapter contains framing questions, common errors, easy-to-use rules of thumb, clearly stated outcomes, and examples showing ID in action. The basic model and its application within constructivism and user-design will help teachers adapt from a behavioral approach to a more open, student-centered design approach. Combining basics with strategies to implement this model in the most advanced instructional approaches, this book empowers teachers and learners to use good instructional design with the most recent research-based approaches to learning. Instructional Design for Teachers shows how ID principles can impact instructional moments in positive and practical ways. The book can be used for basic ID courses and introductory curriculum courses, and is accessible to in-service as well as pre-service teachers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: Through the study of the computer aided English teaching, it can better serve the modern English teaching, improve the teaching quality and efficiency, and promote the teaching fun. Methods: The use of computer aided foreign language teaching is a technology for the application of computer multimedia in foreign language teaching. It is not only a new foreign language teaching mode, but also the application of multimedia technology in teaching and learning. Process: The theory of constructivism is that students are the main body of learning, and it is the active construction of knowledge meaning. The process of learning is a process of meaning construction, which is the process of interaction, is the process of self-diagnosis and reflection. The construction of computer aided English teaching will bring different results. Conclusion: The teaching mode of computer English based on constructivism learning theory has the characteristics of situational, interactive, personalized and self-diagnosis. It can satisfy the requirements of the constructivist learning theory to English learning and learning environment. © 2015, UK Simulation Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As more and more library and LIS education migrates to the online environment, college and university faculty are called upon to expand their pedagogy. Interactivity has been cited as one factor in attracting and retaining students in online courses and programs. LIS educators can reach outside the online learning management system (LMS) to discover Web-based tools to develop more interactive learning experiences for students’ use in the virtual classroom. These activities and tools can help faculty as they enact a social constructivist teaching philosophy that increases the focus on students engaging with course content while they learn with and from one another as well as from the instructor. This paper describes one educator’s journey in stretching boundaries and using student-created Web 2.0 tools and multimedia to curate course content and support students’ collaborative learning experiences and collective meaning-making. © 2015, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

abstract={The use of online methodologies to deliver coursework has become institutionalized in higher education. There is an urgent need to move beyond the question of which delivery model is most effective: face-toface, fully online, or blended, and switch the focus to teaching pedagogy and strategies that effectively engage students in the learning process. This chapter posits that student-learning outcomes are less dependent on delivery mode and instead dependent on a teacher's pedagogical practices; it is the skill of the teacher as facilitator that drives the effective development of the learning community and influences student-learning outcomes. Further, it is suggested that constructivism, as a pedagogy of teaching, be considered, regardless of delivery mode; students construct their own knowledge as the teacher facilitates the process through providing opportunities for active engagement and critical inquiry within a community of learners. Teaching opportunities are adapted in response to the needs of students with technology as a tool to deliver learning outcomes. © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={This paper describes the ways in which social constructivist learning was fostered in an online teacher education program. In fall, 2010 we launched an online Masters of Education (M.Ed) and in spring, 2011 and began an online version of the on-campus Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) at a small liberal arts university. The development and implementation of these online programs presented new pedagogical challenges and questions. We focused the inquiry on how to adapt a community-focused, constructivist, oncampus pedagogy to an online format. Grounded in and driven by social constructivism, we identified several essential online tools and instructional methods that facilitated the kind of candidate-candidate and candidate-teacher interaction desired. This paper explores the potential of certain online tools and methods to facilitate a social constructivist approach to preparing teachers in a virtual program model. © 2015, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

abstract={The creation of online platforms that establish new learning environments has led to the proliferation of institutions offering online learning programmes. However, the use of technologies for teaching and learning requires sound content specialization, as well as grounding in pedagogy. While gains made by constructivism and observational learning are well documented, research addressing online practices that best encourage constructivist and observational learning in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) contexts is limited. Using a phenomenological methodological approach, this research explored the lived experiences of online learning programme facilitators at an Open and Distance Learning higher education institution. The findings of this research study revealed that facilitators did not use constructivist and observational learning pedagogies to a large extent in their interaction with students. It is concluded that during the curriculum planning phase, facilitators should decide on methods and media to arouse the students' attention and stimulating constructivist and observational learning amongst students during online courses. This also implies a more reasonable facilitator-student ratio because large numbers of students per facilitator proves not feasible in online learning. The paper concludes by providing guidelines for the facilitation of interactive online learning programmes.},

abstract={This study aimed to explore the relationship between students’ online participation in Moodle and their learning achievement. Participants in the study were 78 undergraduate full-time students who were enrolled in a general education course entitled “Digital Citizenship” at a higher education institute in Hong Kong. They were required to choose from and participate in different types of Moodle activities including information access (e.g., reading online supplementary resources), interactive learning (e.g., running online simulations), networked learning (e.g., discussing in online forums), and materials development (e.g., writing reflective journals). The online participation of a student was measured by the number of completed activities, while the learning achievement of a student was determined by his/her essay grade. This study applied the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method to the collected data in order to identify whether there was a link between online participation and learning achievement. The results indicate that online participation in networked learning or in materials development, but not in information access nor in interactive learning, was positively and significantly related to learning achievement. This finding highlights the importance of social interaction and individual constructivism for effective online learning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={In this research we present a new design component for online learning communities (OLC); one that integrates Twitter with an online discussion board (ODB). We introduce our design across two sections of upper-division information systems courses at a university located within the U.S. The first section consisted of full-time online learners, while the second section met face-to-face twice a week. Guided by a working theoretical model for how individuals learn and interact within OLCs, we measure student perceptions of learning, social interaction and course community before and after our intervention. Initial findings were largely positive and students across both sections experienced high levels of learning, interaction and community. Our results pave the way for more integrated learning environments that incorporate online social networking (OSN) technologies. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Adult learners bring life and work experiences into the classroom beyond those of the traditional undergraduate student. These same students, however, often lack a firm foundation in the college-level language arts, mathematics, humanities, et al. that help round out perspective and fine-tune critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Although adult students can draw upon a richer context when building new knowledge, they typically exhibit knowledge gaps that must be closed in order to successfully continue on to higher-level coursework. For this reason, courses should be designed and taught with their specific strengths and needs in mind. The development of a modular, hybrid online teaching approach incorporating and employing varying teaching approaches including andragogy, constructivism, collaboration, critical thinking, and other techniques and tools is described. The application of this method to courses in the context of a specialised adult learner programme is examined. The employment of this and related approaches, and the implications for adult learners and universities, is also examined. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This study investigates the potential of an online intellectual transformation system acronym as i-InTranS, in enhancing intellectual transformation. Using Moodle as the learning management system, the system was proposed to deliver a content that was customized to embrace hypothetical-deductive learning cycle (HDLC) as the inquiry model. A total of 35 students in the district of Johor Bahru, Malaysia were selected through cluster random sampling technique to use the proposed system. Based on mean scores of Intellectual Level Tests, it can be concluded that there are differences between users' intellectual level before using the proposed system, i-InTranS and after using it. © 2014 Mohd Shafie Rosli, Baharuddin Aris and Maizah Hura Ahmad.},

abstract={In this era of rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), online collaborative and social learning has been seen as one of the ways to encourage students' critical thinking skills. Past studies have proven that students' critical thinking skills were shown significantly when it is done socially and collaboratively amongst peers. Previous researches also stated that cooperative teams achieve at higher levels of thought and preserve information longer than learners who work quietly as individuals. In addition, working in a collaborative environment also involves processes of evidence and argumentation. Argumentation refers to making convincing claims backed up by sound evidence and broad understanding of various aspects of an issue. Argumentation learning activities can serve as an effective mechanism of spreading of knowledge through a network of exchanges in small groups. However, argumentative knowledge construction (AKC) in social collaborative learning environments is often insubstantial. So, does an argumentative learning activity in social collaborative learning environment truly result in enhancing students' higher order thinking skills (HOTs) and knowledge construction? Thus, the purpose of this paper is to discuss a meta-analysis on thinking skills that lead to the need for social collaborative learning and argumentative knowledge construction process towards enhancing students' HOTs. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={It has been acknowledged that the traditional didactic lecture does not always provide the ideal learning and teaching experience (Bligh, 1998). Over the last ten years, individuals and institutions have been exploring the pedagogical possibilities of providing more active and engaging alternatives. One model in particular has been influential in sparking change. The use of Active Learning Spaces (ALS) combined with team-based learning (Fink, Michaelsen & Knight, 2004) has been successfully used in initiatives such as TEAL (Technology Enhanced Active Learning) and SCALE-UP (Baepler, Brooks & Walker, 2014). This approach has proved popular in North America, and has attracted growing interest in the UK. The key benefits demonstrated have been improvements in: class attendance; retention rates; levels of conceptual understanding; pace of learning (Beichner, Saul, Abbott, et al., 2007). This ongoing comparative study set out to establish the key drivers and barriers to the development of ALS and the future landscape for classroom pedagogies that are being adopted within these innovative spaces. A mixed methodology has been adopted to triangulate the needs, expectations and opinions of three key stakeholders: students, academics, and policy makers. A series of focus group interviews were conducted with students and lecturers, and an online questionnaire completed by senior managers representing a range of UK Higher Education Institutions. The analysis of the results so far point to a burgeoning awareness amongst students and staff of the positive educational impact of newer pedagogies such as the 'flipped classroom' and 'inquiry based learning', alongside an intensifying impatience with the status quo. From the institutional perspective, aside from the financial implications, a formidable hurdle is the pressure on physical space, and thus, room occupancy rates. ALS typically reduce room occupancy by 25-30%, however previous studies have indicated attendance at lectures rarely exceed 60% of the cohort (Dobkin, Gil & Marion, 2007), and a recent evaluation of learning spaces at one HEI demonstrated a room utilization rate of just 27%. There is now a clear rationale for the creation of teaching spaces that effectively support technology enhanced pedagogies which attract, engage and retain students across the whole academic cycle. In this paper we will discuss the current results of our study in relation to critical questions around ALS and the flipped classroom, and more broadly the strategic decisions around estate management versus the demands and expectations of students and staff. © 2016.},

abstract={During only a few years, MOOCs have been widespread adopted and accepted as part of the educational agenda. The massive aspect, the social networking, and the idea of new student roles where the student is the main responsible for self-organizing her or his participation are main drivers in the learning processes. The current development of MOOCs can be seen as having two distinct directions; cMOOCs, defined by a participative pedagogical model based on the principles of connectivism, which is introduced as a new learning theory; and xMOOCS, developed as extensions of traditional courses, and to a higher degree based on an instructional model. However, as MOOCs have spread globally and developed, this dichotomy is no longer sufficient. From a mapping of UK MOOCs, Bayne and Ross suggest that the emergence of MOOCs gives rise to discussions of central pedagogical questions of What, How and Whom, which are well-known and not yet solved issues in e-learning (Bayne and Ross, 2013, p. 8). We therefore wish to discuss MOOCs from more multiple perspectives and raise issues which emerge from the current reports on practices with MOOCs. A social constructivist perspective on learning acknowledges both the participatory approach to learning and the role of the teacher as an important moderator of students' learning processes. Using this as a pedagogical model for a large scale programme like MOOC is of course challenging. A recent study on students' interaction and collaboration shows that the large scale make students search for other students with whom they share goals, and suggests that scaffolding activities of the teacher may be practiced by adding supportive posts with important learning patterns (Andersen et al, 2014). The scaffolding learning activities (Vygotsky, 1986) based on a culture of discussion and critical thinking draw on insights from the field of it-didactic design, with an emphasis on the students' own design of their learning processes. In a large scale programme, where moderating activities may be distributed to assisting students/teachers, the didactic competence among students may draw on the technologies of connectivity in combination with the pedagogy of social constructivism, where instructions and discussions provide new patterns for understanding.},

abstract={Reflecting the latest trends in technical and technological development, mobile devices have become standard didactic means both in foreign language and other subjects' instruction on all levels of education. The use of wireless, mobile, portable and handheld devices is gradually increasing and diversifying across every sector of education in both the developed and developing worlds. The mobile learning currently exploits both handheld computers and mobile (smart) telephones and other devices that work on the same set of functionalities. The use of handheld computers is obviously relatively immature in terms of both its technologies and its pedagogies, but it is developing rapidly. This study focuses on the use of mobile devices within teaching/learning English for specific purposes (ESP) in technical (bachelor) and engineering (master) higher education in Informatics and Management-related study programmes. Mobile devices were understood to be very small items which users carry anytime anywhere without the electrical supply been required. The research was conducted at the Faculty of Informatics and Management (FIM), University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic, monitoring what mobile devices students use for personal and education purposes. Running more than 250 online courses in LMS Blackboard in 2013/14 at FIM, since 2013/14 the Blackboard Mobile Learn™ version 4.0 for Apple and Android devices has been available and piloted. Totally in 21 ESP courses mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) principles were applied. The full versions of courses run traditionally within the LMS, and they were available on mobile devices in the limited extent as well. In other words, the blended learning model is applied which combines the distance form of study in online courses and personalized approach through mobile devices which satisfies the individual time/place preferences and bridges formal and informal learning. Three research questions were set to be researched. Are students sufficiently equipped with mobile devices? What purposes do students use the mobile devices? What is the studentś feedback after the MALL? These questions resulted from the background of the FRAME (Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education) model by Marguerite L. Koole. The model can/should be used to design a more efficient mobile learning process, as it takes into consideration the technical characteristics of mobile devices as well as social and personal aspects of learning and it places more emphasis on constructivism.},

abstract={A variety of approaches have been adopted by institutions of higher education offering programmes in translator training. Some of these approaches are centred on early training, while others on socio-constructivism. Presenting a facet of training that differs from that generally used in most programmes, this paper examines how the task-based approaches used over the course of the curriculum and the project-based approaches adopted in the final year in the form of translation portfolio can be an integral part of an undergraduate translation programme run by distance learning. Translation students' performance while completing the project online is used as the data supported with online questionnaires. A critical analysis of these issues engenders a crucial discussion of increased student autonomy. The project-based translation portfolio is better suited to more advanced students, whereas the task-based translation activities to those students at the early stages of training. Nevertheless, the two approaches are compatible and complementary.},

abstract={Schools in New York City have made attempts to embrace and support the strand of ‘making connections’, which is laid out in the New York City Department of Dance blueprint for teaching and learning in dance for grades PreK-12. Accordingly, some schools have integrated Ugandan traditional dances into the dance curriculum, and dance teachers have employed emerging technologies as part of instructional methodologies in teaching these dances. Anchored in the theoretical framework of constructivism and the idea of concept and realisation in constructing dance knowledge, this article reveals how the author employed emerging technologies and online platforms such as ipads, smartboards, ipods, iphones, audio recorders, YouTube and wikispace in teaching Ugandan traditional dances to: reconcile contextual and content knowledge in the classroom; engage students in reflective and interpretive analyses and deconstruction of dance songs and movements; give feedback to and receive reflections from students; and explore issues relating to learning to dance, learning through dance, and learning about dance. The author further divulges how dilemmas that relate to re/presentation and appropriation of ephemerally, culturally and contextually celebrated, embodied and defined dances imposed limitations on execution of technologically mediated class activities. © 2015 British Educational Research Association.},

abstract={This study focused on the civic education course at Universitas Terbuka (UT). Its purpose was to design a new approach for the online tutorial for the course by analyzing the literature related to online and distance education and investigating participant feedback on the current offering of the course and tutorial, which is a compulsory course in all programs at UT. The study draws from the community of inquiry framework, which promotes a social constructivist approach as well as teaching about democracy by example. This model is intended to create meaningful learning experiences for students in a reformulated civic education course, in which they would learn to think critically through interacting with classmates, experiencing collaborative learning, and supporting fellow students in learning activities and processes. In this model, learning is seen as occurring within the community through the interaction of social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence where, students are able to develop civic competences, namely civic knowledge, civic skills, and civic dispositions, as well as experience a democratic interaction that forms the core of civic interactions in a democratic society. © 2015 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.},

abstract={E-learning since 1990s is still evolving. Currently, there is a shift towards e-collaborative teaching and learning approaches. Despite this shift, there is still a gap between constructivist online teaching and learning and actual practices in higher educational institutions. The objective of this paper is to propose a constructivist didactic framework for e-collaboration for higher educational institutions. The methodologies employed include an exploratory and explanatory study of prior related concepts, theories and frameworks. These were followed by keywords identifications, brainstorming, selections and iteration. Results indicated that the five learning theories studied support collaboration have overlapping design principles and didactics methods. Findings from the nine frameworks studied also presented some useful elements integrated into the framework. On the whole, the derived framework integrates iterative development process, users' roles, collaboration process, evaluation tools, and social media for synchronous and asynchronous collaborations. The comprehensive nature of the resulting framework is clear enough to guide research. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to design and evaluate the effectiveness business law e module. A total 27 business law students participate in this study. These are business management’s students. Firstly these students were given ‘need analysis’ questionnaires, secondly the e module was designed. The e module was design according to the ‘need analysis’ questionnaires from the student incorporating with ‘student learning style. Lastly the e module was evaluated by the same students. The result proves that most of the content such as the definition of the related topics, sections involved, explanation about the videography, quizzes, tests and case exercises need to be included in the law module. Majority, the students agreed about the multiple answer questions, fill in the blanks and also the questions about the case study where the feedback shows the positive responds. However, some of the students also facing certain limitation during the learning of business law module. Among the students experience regarding the internet, they were really good in it. The computer lab facilities also provided in most of the students IPT. Based on the business law e module learning, 90% of the students has agreed about the contents such as the material of business law, delivery technique, simple language, notes in term of tables and figure, and also the presentation of current and previous knowledge in training activities. Furthermore, they were also agreed on the application skills as well as the theory skills in learning and teaching. The application of Cognitive Theory, Interactional, Behavioral and Constructivism also clearly understood by the respondents as the use of text, diagrams which to help students in Business Law, two-way interaction between students and learning materials. Cronbach’s alpha obtained also shows a consistency and reliability of the questionnaire. An average of 0.773 for each section has proven the consistency of the questionnaire in this study.

abstract={Background: With the uptake of distance learning (DL), which has been marginal for most clinical academics, teaching contexts, traditional power structures and relationships have changed, leaving lecturers potentially disenfranchised. DL has caused a distinct change in academic roles, but academic and institutional routines have remained unchanged. Information surrounding the changes is confusing and lacks clear guidance.
Aim: To provide a pragmatic outline of roles, responsibilities, obstacles and solutions for clinical academics involved in DL.
Method: A two-year action research project was carried out examining the academic role when developing and delivering a 20 credit post graduate DL module in Clinical Education at Newcastle University. It entailed three strands which were "active" for two weeks at a time in which all activities had to be completed. Sixteen students participated in the module consisting of independent activities, facilitated discussion forums, wikis, required reading, individual and group tasks. Pedagogically, it was based on heavily on Garrison's (2012) and Salmon's (2008) work on constructivism and online communities.
Results: Institutions need a clear plan and a change of culture. Roles have emerged including: administrator, manager, team leader knowledge expert, moderator and facilitator.
Conclusions: Universities struggle to engage staff with DL due to its unrecognised and (many academics believe) unsustainable workload. These 12 tips provide academics and managers involved in clinical education with clear guidance surrounding strategies that inform practice. New roles have emerged, work habits must be revolutionised and changes in routine must be addressed. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract={The use of online methodologies to deliver coursework has become institutionalized in higher education. There is an urgent need to move beyond the question of which delivery model is most effective: face-toface, fully online, or blended, and switch the focus to teaching pedagogy and strategies that effectively engage students in the learning process. This chapter posits that student-learning outcomes are less dependent on delivery mode and instead dependent on a teacherÂ™s pedagogical practices; it is the skill of the teacher as facilitator that drives the effective development of the learning community and influences student-learning outcomes. Further, it is suggested that constructivism, as a pedagogy of teaching, be considered, regardless of delivery mode; students construct their own knowledge as the teacher facilitates the process through providing opportunities for active engagement and critical inquiry within a community of learners. Teaching opportunities are adapted in response to the needs of students with technology as a tool to deliver learning outcomes. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is increased pressure on higher education (HE) graphic design lecturers to provide a more engaged platform for the evolving digitally engrossed student. This article explores Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as an educational experiment to help envision changes in HE design teaching. MOOCs have presented aspects of a plausible, although unresolved, online teaching model that has challenged many long-held beliefs of learning and teaching. This investigation considers aspects of MOOCs and their capacity to drive innovation in design education. It will analyse how these features might alleviate some of the pressures on teachers and enable a deeper dialectic in the learning space. I will argue that the importance of this study rests in the questions it raises about the capacity for design education to exploit the benefits of this ‘massive’ experiment. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.},

abstract={This paper describes a classroom-tested instructional resource, grounded in principles of active learning and a constructivism, that embraces two primary objectives: ‘demystify’ for accounting students technical material from statistics regarding ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression analysis – material that students may find obscure or overly abstract – and increase student knowledge regarding the use of Excel for cost-estimation purposes. The resource consists of a set of seven student-related files – PowerPoint slides, Word documents, and Excel files – divided into two major parts: four files that deal with simple (i.e., one-variable) linear regression and three files related to the incremental unit-time learning-curve model. A separate Word file, meant for instructors, provides detailed guidance regarding the use of the student-based files. The resource is flexible in that it can be used at both graduate and undergraduate courses in cost/management accounting; customized to meet the needs of individual instructors (coverage of the entire resource requires approximately seven hours of in-class time) and used in conjunction with any cost/management accounting textbook. Throughout the resource many references to related online supplemental materials are provided, including links to relevant online video clips. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The use of online methodologies to deliver coursework has become institutionalized in higher education. There is an urgent need to move beyond the question of which delivery model is most effective: face-toface, fully online, or blended, and switch the focus to teaching pedagogy and strategies that effectively engage students in the learning process. This chapter posits that student-learning outcomes are less dependent on delivery mode and instead dependent on a teacher's pedagogical practices; it is the skill of the teacher as facilitator that drives the effective development of the learning community and influences student-learning outcomes. Further, it is suggested that constructivism, as a pedagogy of teaching, be considered, regardless of delivery mode; students construct their own knowledge as the teacher facilitates the process through providing opportunities for active engagement and critical inquiry within a community of learners. Teaching opportunities are adapted in response to the needs of students with technology as a tool to deliver learning outcomes. © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={In this chapter, the authors address the question of how educators can creative collaborative learning in online courses, especially in those courses that occur in a global context. They use constructivism as a theoretical framework, and they review the literature related to collaborative learning, learner-centered teaching, groups in online learning, cultural competence in online teaching, and research on online learning. The authors present two case studies, one in which collaborative learning occurred, and one in which the collaborative component was less developed, even though the content of the courses were the same and the same educator facilitated the courses. The authors conclude the chapter by suggesting areas of further research on collaboration in online learning. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The research work provides a case study of an effective use of e-learning to supplement face-to-face teaching-and-learning in a second-year Zoology course at the University of the Western Cape. This work was undertaken as part of a study to develop a pedagogy for effectively introducing and integrating artefact-production as a teaching-and-learning technique. The study is underpinned by the theoretical framework of Activity theory and Constructivism. Data sources include observations and interviews conducted with students as well as the artefacts produced using Microsoft Producer and PowerPoint (CD and DVD presentations). The report highlights the impact of the construction of an artefact on the learning experience of students in the course and demonstrates the value of having students use technology to construct their own learning, rather than using technology purely to interact with artefacts developed by others. The report focuses on the dynamic interaction within student groups with varying levels of computer literacy. The study concludes that technology is best introduced in a well-structured course where excitement is derived from the content. Moreover, that the appropriate use of technology serves to increase the retention of information by providing multiple and varied opportunities for interaction with subject content. Although the study was undertaken in a face-to-face classroom, the results can be applied to e-learning supported by Web technologies. This can be achieved by creating artefacts that can be viewed and manipulated in a web browser, and by providing online tools to facilitate their creation and use, as well as for providing assessment and feedback.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this study is to examine similar and/or different perspectives on, and practices of online-learning interaction as projected by the participating educators who are from either Korea or the USA. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the authors analyzed how college instructors from two countries, Korea and the USA, consider the role of online-learning interaction in their students’ learning by interviewing nine instructors from both countries. The authors examined the educators’ responses using constructivism and Confucianism as the frame of reference. Findings – The analysis showed that the US instructors tend to focus on learner-to-learner interaction, whereas Korean instructors emphasized teacher-to-learner interaction. Korean instructors perceived a gap between ideal and reality in integrating interaction as a part of online activities in the course. Originality/value – This study focuses on a cross-national comparison of online-learning interaction between Korea and the USA. Thus, it will provide practical ideas for global or multicultural user experiences on online-learning courses. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This chapter explores the underlying theoretical principles that provided the basis for the design and implementation of a professional development program for informatics teachers in Greece. A blended learning model was adopted combining live workshop meetings, face-to-face in-lab training sessions and online videoconferencing sessions. The framework of constructivism and experiential learning was used as a theoretical rationale for the combination of face-to-face activities with online learning experiences. It is shown that a blended learning design based on the principles of constructivism and experiential learning pedagogy can provide vital tools for the creation of an active environment for informatics teachers' professional development. Also, it appears that a promising direction for further investigation, in terms of improving the learning outcome based on the same theoretical principles, is the more detailed design of the sequence of learning activities and a closer look at the development of communities of practice among teachers. © 2014, IGI Global.

abstract={The interactive and collaborative nature of wikis offers opportunities for language learning beyond traditional pedagogy. This study examined the use of wikis in an EFL writing classroom. The aim was to explore the extent to which wikis can facilitate collaboration and promote foreign language acquisition through a social constructivist perspective. The instruments used in this study include two online questionnaires, interviews with randomly selected participants and students' reflections on using wikis for collaborative writing. Findings indicate that wikis increase the students' motivation to learn English, enhance their writing confidence and promote their initiatives for social constructivist learning. Most of the students enjoyed performing group tasks in the wiki-meditated environment because they found it to be engaging, challenging and interesting. The results also suggest that collaboration on a wiki in an EFL setting can contribute to both language development and social interaction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Social interactions to supplement learning and asynchronous tools to facilitate exchange of quality ideas have gained much attention in information systems education. While various systems exist, students have difficulty with deep processing of complex instructional materials (e.g., concepts of a theory and pedagogical support mechanisms derived from a theory). This research proposes a theoretical framework that leverages attention guidance in a social constructivist approach to facilitate processing of central domain concepts, principles, and their interrelations. Using an open source anchored discussion system, we designed a set of instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance functionalities involving dynamic manipulation of text font size similar to tag clouds. We conducted an experimental study with two small groups of first-year doctoral students in a blended-learning classroom format. Students in the control group had no access to attention guidance functions. Students in the treatment group used instructor-based attention guidance functionality and then switched to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality. The evaluation compared focus, content, and sequential organization of students' online discussion messages with heat maps, content analysis, sequential analysis, and statistical discourse analysis to examine different facets of the phenomenon in a holistic way. The results show that in areas where students struggle to understand challenging concepts, instructor-based attention guidance functionality facilitated elaboration and negotiation of ideas, which is fundamental to higher order thinking. In addition, after switching to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality, students in the treatment group took the lead in pinpointing challenging concepts they did not previously understand. These findings indicate that instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance functionalities offer students an indirect way of focusing their attention on deep processing of challenging concepts in an inherently open learning environment. Implications for theory, software design, and future research are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. Allrights reserved.},

abstract={The mission of this chapter is to explain the extensive step-by-step process involved in creating and teaching an online university humanities course based upon the primary educational philosophy called "constructivism." Instead of using a distance learning or correspondence model, the University of Maryland University College's learning approach focuses on "construction and engagement" or intensive interaction among students and professors. This social engagement (professor to student and student to student) requires more time, energy, and thought on the part of students and faculty members than face-to-face teaching. As a case study in teaching the History of the American West online within an intensive eight-week course length, this chapter provides concrete information about the course's required concepts, skills, goals and objectives, project assignments, conference participation requirements for threaded discussions, assessment methods, and grading rubrics. The case study also addresses the current challenges facing the implementation of the course and offers recommendations. Although some of the details specifically relate to teaching a history course, they are applicable to any humanities course. © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={The essence of this chapter is to discuss theories and practices including approaches that instructional designers consider when designing Web-based instruction for adult learners. The importance of the chapter is to discuss best practice activities and theories as well as technologies that enable adult online learners to be involved in the design of their Web-based instruction. This represents recognition that adults have accumulated a repertoire of knowledge and experiences that inevitably will enrich the course materials. The theories discussed in this chapter are constructivism and connectivism; these theories improve adult involvement and help them to establish learning networks for exchanges of ideas using cultural artifacts and various interactive and video technologies. These technologies include Adobe Connect, Camtasia, Articulate Storyline, SoftChalk, Prezi, Google.docs, and Google Hangout. The idea is to provide rich virtual learning environments to help adult learners explore learning and connect with each other without inhibition. The traditional method of instruction, which is teacher-centered, is considered inadequate for the present digital age with its rapid knowledge transformation. The roles of technology leaders within the institutional leadership and factors that may impact negatively on Webbased instruction for adults are also considered. © 2014, IGI Global.

abstract={Improvements in technology and changing learner requirements challenge educational institutions to address learner needs. Some of these challenges include facilitating online learning and accommodating learner inputs. Addressing these needs helps learners to be effective and the educational institution to be a successful educator. Formative assessment is seen as a process that accommodates learner inputs to improve learning. Recent developments in online learning can better accommodate formative assessment in virtual learning environments. We seek to understand the role of formative assessment in virtual learning environments by reviewing and refining formative assessment from a constructivist learning perspective. This research synthesizes our understanding of the role formative assessment plays in virtual learning environments and provides a theoretical foundation for further development of formative assessment.},

CIRCLE uses recent research findings in collaboration, constructivism, mobile development, and retrieval learning to develop a multi-user tool for the identification and classification of real world objects. CIRCLE supports group efforts at taxonomy building by providing a framework for data gathering in the field and scientific hypothesizing and debate in a virtual laboratory. Future plans include a pilot usability study and classroom experiments to determine the effectiveness of the approach towards learning the identification of rocks and minerals (in a geology lab), weeds (in a weed identification course), and animals (in an ecology class). © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2014.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to determine if the introduction of game design has an impact on the learning of information literacy concepts among undergraduate students. The study proposes a descriptive case study which draws upon the theories of social constructivism and motivation to explore the phenomenon learning by game design. The study was conducted in an online one credit information literacy class. Preliminary findings offer insight into the use of game design in learning scenarios.},

abstract={In educational discourse on human learning (i.e. the result of experience) and development (i.e. the result of maturation), there are three fundamental theoretical frameworks, - behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism, each of which have been applied, with varying degrees of success, in online environments. An ecological framework of human learning and development in interactive learning environments is proposed. Such an inclusive paradigm organizes the fundamental theoretical assumptions of behaviourism (i.e. automated learning), cognitivism (i.e. recall, understanding, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, creativity, problem solving) and constructivism (i.e. private and shared meaning). Based on review of the literature, behaviourism is best conceptualized as a learning theory; constructivist theoretical assumptions are best applied to cognitive development including private online experience (cognitive constructivism) and shared online experience (social constructivism). Cognitivism is a particularly relevant theoretical orientation in understanding both human learning and development in interactive learning environments. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Despite the hype and speculation about the role massively open online courses (MOOCs) may play in higher education, empirical research that explores the realities of interacting and learning in MOOCs is in its infancy. MOOCs have evolved from previous incarnations of online learning but are distinguished in their global reach and semi-synchronicity. Thus, it is important to understand the ways that learners from around the world interact in these settings. In this paper, we ask three questions: (1) What are the demographic characteristics of students that participate in MOOC discussion forums? (2) What are the discussion patterns that characterize their interactions? And (3) How does participation in discussion forums relate to students' final scores? Analysis of nearly 87,000 individuals from one MOOC reveals three key trends. First, forum participants tend to be young adults from the Western world. Secondly, these participants assemble and disperse as crowds, not communities, of learners. Finally, those that engage explicitly in the discussion forums are often higher-performing than those that do not, although the vast majority of forum participants receive "failing" marks. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of future MOOCs, and how they are conceptualised as part of higher education. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Blended Learning is now in evolution, by providing the best mix of face-to-face learning and e-learning activities, in which learners are actively engaged in a competency and constructivism based learning process. A special focus is on integrating experiential learning activities in the course. Practical exercises and experiments and problem-solving are organized as face to face sessions often in special lab rooms or even outside the classroom and on site of a project partner. A mix or blend of e-learning (self-study), experiential classroom activities and virtual class activities is the most flexible and social hybrid learning model. It guarantees an effective learning process, in collaboration with peers, the teaching team and external experts. Smart teaching technologies do exist to develop this kind of hybrid learning course. Lecture capturing is increasingly in demand as a method of developing online lectures. Lecture capturing means making a digital copy of the lecture and publish it as an online video. Life lecture capturing is creating videos of the life lectures and lab developed lecture capturing is creating videos in a lab of a simulation of the lecture. In a course mathematics of Hasselt University, a hybrid learning model has been defined. To support learners an etutor is developed based on the lab lecture capturing technology. Students evaluated that e-tutor.},

We formulated internal personalized learning mechanisms by implementing intelligent agents in a VLE under a constructivist learning model and further developed an e-learning effectiveness framework by integrating educational and IS theories. An empirical field experiment involving 228 university students was conducted. The findings suggested that personalized e-learning facilities enhance online learning effectiveness in terms of examination, satisfaction, and self-efficacy criteria. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper’s main aim is to identify and discuss the areas of E-learning strategy of Chinese private university that are important in describing the state of university teaching and students learning, specifically related to the need for systems and actions for student support system. As a basis for illustrating E-learning strategy of EFL pedagogy in Sweden the paper presents different theoretical approaches to distance teaching and learning such as student independence and autonomy, teaching-learning conversation, guided didactic conversation, continuity of concern for students and cooperative learning and constructivism. The paper further discusses the conflict of interest between students who prefer cooperative learning methods and students who both prefer and need a high degree of flexibility to be able to enrol and succeed in E-learning programs. The paper also discusses different models explaining E-learning education. High quality E-learning education systems have traditionally emphasised student support and continuous concern for students from enrolment to completion. It is the author’s view that theory and practices from online education are valid for E-learning and should be implemented into E-learning practice. Finally, the author presents a theoretical framework for student support services in online distance education with his own institution. The conclusion of this paper is to identify the pedagogical principles underlying the teaching and learning activities that constitute effective E-Learning in Chinese private university. An analysis and synthesis of the principles and ideas by practicing Elearning will also be presented, in the perspective of deploying an effective Learning Management Systems (LMS) as means of teaching pedagogy. © 2014 WIT Press.},

abstract={Introduction: The purpose of this study was to explore how a community of practice promoted the creation and sharing of new knowledge in evidence-based manual therapy using Wenger's constructs of mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire as a theoretical framework. Methods: We used a qualitative approach to analyze the discussion board contributions of the 19 physiotherapists who participated in the 10-week online continuing education course in evidence-based practice (EBP) in manual therapy. The course was founded on community of practice, constructivism, social, and situated learning principles. Results: The 1436 postings on 9 active discussion boards revealed that the community of practice was a social learning environment that supported strong participation and mutual engagement. Design features such as consistent facilitation, weekly guiding questions, and collaborative assignments promoted the creation and sharing of knowledge. Participants applied research evidence to the contexts in which they worked through reflective comparison of what they were reading to its applicability in their everyday practice. Participants' shared goals contributed to the common ground established in developing collective knowledge about different study designs, how to answer research questions, and the difficulties of conducting sound research. Discussion: An online longitudinal community of practice utilized as a continuing education approach to deliver an online course based on constructivist and social learning principles allowed geographically dispersed physiotherapists to be mutually engaged in a joint enterprise in evidence-based manual therapy. Advantages included opportunity for reflection, modeling, and collaboration. Future studies should examine the impact of participation on clinical practice. © 2014 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.},

abstract={Connect for organic chemistry is an online learning tool that gives students the opportunity to learn about all aspects of organic chemistry through the ease of the digital world. This research project consisted of two fundamental questions. The first was to discover whether there was a difference in undergraduate organic chemistry content knowledge between students at a public institution who complete homework assignments online and those who complete homework assignments on paper. The second was to determine what kind of effect online homework had on student learning. Courses were designated at random to perform either online homework or traditional homework. At the end of the semester, students were asked to fill out a survey regarding their thoughts on the homework method used for their course. Students' exam grades were then analyzed. Students who utilized the Connect homework program did significantly better than those who completed traditional homework (p < 0.006, n = 112). The ACS average exam percentile score for sections using online homework was higher, 59.5, than those who used paper homework, 45.9. From the surveys, students mentioned that feedback and ease of use were the primary advantages to the online homework system. © 2014 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

abstract={Mobile learning opens up for collaboration and sharing of contents. This study discusses the outcome of a mobile SMS based Twitter implementation to facilitate collaborative learning among a group of young farmers. The mobile learning approach (mLA) was developed in collaboration with the study community using a design based research process for a period of two years. The objectives of the study were to analyse the learning process based on constructivism learning theories, study the learner interactions in the mLA, the impact of mLA, and the potential uses of the mLA in collaborative learning. Data were collected using questionnaires, follow up discussions and through logged data in the devices. The data were analysed using descriptive methods, qualitative data analysis methods, and network analysis methods respectively. The mLA assisted learners to construct knowledge, and obtain useful feedback to reinforce learning through the interaction within mobile learning environment. The participants were satisfied with the mobile learning experience however there were some drawbacks needed to be addressed in the future. Since participants didn't have adequate previous experience, they faced some technical difficulties in receiving tweets in the mobile phones. Difficulty in moving for higher order learning skills and limited opportunities for collaborations due to SMS based platform and interface were the other drawbacks. Learners needed more technical support and assistance together with better interface to promote collaborative learning opportunities in the future. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a follow-up research which explored existing research with potentials for new insight for improving the effectiveness and use of Web 2.0 technology tools in learning in higher education. The first research used quantitative methods to validate the model that it developed. The research presented in this paper follows up the work by adopting a conversational approach of data collection in focus groups that consisted of management staff and lecturers. Data collection was done using unstructured interviews with 36 academics in two Nigerian institutions in a workshop aimed at creating awareness on the usefulness of Web 2.0 to enhance collaborative, problem solving and critical thinking skills. The research gathered through participatory activities constructive views on acceptance and effective use of Web 2.0 technology tools for learning from academic and management point of view and also compared these views with the quantitative findings in the previous research. The findings were that the research constructs are significantly related to acceptance and effective use of these tools for learning and these constructs are perceived usefulness, ease of use, social factor, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, prior knowledge and motivation. © 2014 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.},

abstract={Concern over student engagement has highlighted the inability of learning management systems (LMS) to accommodate the social side of learning. The emergence of social networks and their widespread adoption by students has opened new avenues for mediating different modes of learning. This work seeks to capitalise on the informal interactions of social networks, the structure of learning programmes and the multiple facets of collaborative approaches, in order to enhance student engagement. These are integrated into a framework which supports non-formal learning and facilitates knowledge creation and sharing through socialisation, externalisation and combination. A programme element - defined by a curriculum structure- and a collaborative element - identified by collaborative activities - are grafted onto the social fabric of Facebook. The aim of the framework is to promote engagement through a community of practice. Learners are encouraged to share tacit knowledge and co-construct explicit knowledge through social media and a dedicated collaborative tool. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Higher-education institutions are experimenting, designing, and adapting didactic methodologies for students "born online" and are underpinning teaching programmes for developing digital competence in a broader context that goes beyond the simple development of technical skills. In an increasingly interconnected world, more attention is given to ethical aspects and social responsibility practices. This article proposes an experiential approach for developing digital competence in tourism education by considering new technologies and a cooperative learning paradigm. The learning project presented aims to stimulate the new generation of tourism students to be less consumers of pervasive technology in favor of becoming more critical and responsible members of the information society.

abstract={This review of research explores characteristics associated with massive open online courses (MOOCs). Three key characteristics are revealed: varied definitions of openness, barriers to persistence, and a distinct structure that takes the form as one of two pedagogical approaches. The concept of openness shifts among different MOOCs, models, researchers, and facilitators. The high dropout rates show that the barriers to learning are a significant challenge. Research has focused on engagement, motivation, and presence to mitigate risks of learner isolation. The pedagogical structure of the connectivist MOOC model (cMOOC) incorporates a social, distributed, networked approach and significant learner autonomy that is geared towards adult lifelong learners interested in personal or professional development. This connectivist approach relates to situated and social learning theories such as social constructivism (Kop, 2011). By contrast, the design of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence (AI) model (xMOOC) uses conventional directed instruction in the context of formal postsecondary educational institutions. This traditional pedagogical approach is categorized as cognitive-behaviorist (Rodriguez, 2012). These two distinct MOOC models attract different audiences, use different learning approaches, and employ different teaching methods. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the research describing the phenomenon of MOOCs in informal and postsecondary online learning.},

abstract={This study is a review of the creation and evolution of a professional development program modeled on social constructivist principles and designed for online educators in a virtual high school who transitioned from the conventional classroom to the virtual educational environment. The narrative inquiry focuses on the critical events within the professional development program and which were transformational in the process of transitioning from conventional brick and mortar instructor to online educators. In addition, the research examined whether or not the social constructivist inspired methodology modeled in the professional development transferred into the online teachers' classroom practice. The results of this research have contributed to an understanding of the key components required for the design and implementation of a professional development program for teachers who have been trained for conventional classroom practice, but who are now called on to teach online in virtual classrooms.

abstract={While education has been both open and online, the sizeable enrolment numbers associated with massive open online courses (MOOCs) are somewhat unprecedented. In order to gauge the significance of education at scale, this article analyses specific examples of massive participation derived from E-learning and Digital Cultures, a MOOC from the University of Edinburgh in partnership with Coursera. Student-created content, user statistics, and survey data are illustrated to examine the experiences and repercussions of engaging with educational activity where participants number in the tens of thousands. This activity is shown to mirror established instructionist or constructivist approaches to pedagogy. However, rather than working with "massiveness," these positions are suggested to oppose large participant numbers. Concluding remarks propose an irreducible diversity of participation, rather than a generalised categorisation of "student," and call for future considerations of the MOOC to move beyond individualism and self-interest. © 2014 The Author(s).

abstract={The relationship between students' use of PeerWise, an online tool that facilitates peer learning through student-generated content in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and achievement, as measured by their performance in the end-of-module examinations, was investigated in 5 large early-years science modules (in physics, chemistry and biology) across 3 research-intensive UK universities. A complex pattern was observed in terms of which type of activity (writing, answering or commenting on questions) was most beneficial for students; however, there was some evidence that students of lower intermediate ability may have gained particular benefit. In all modules, a modest but statistically significant positive correlation was found between students' PeerWise activity and their examination performance, after taking prior ability into account. This suggests that engaging with the production and discussion of student-generated content in the form of MCQs can support student learning in a way that is not critically dependent on course, institution, instructor or student. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Online environments introduce unprecedented scale for formal and informal learning communities. In these environments, user-contributed content enables social constructivist approaches to education. In particular, students can help each other by providing hints and suggestions on how to approach problems, by rating each other's suggestions, and by engaging in discussions about the questions. In addition, students can also learn through composing their own questions. Furthermore, with grounding in Item Response Theory, data mining and statistical student models can assess questions and hints for their quality and effectiveness. As a result, internet-scale learning environments allow us to move from simple, canned quizzing systems to a new model where automated, data-driven analysis continuously assesses and refines the quality of teaching material. Our poster describes a framework and prototype of an online drill-and-practice system that leverages user-contributed content and large-scale data to organically improve itself.},

abstract={AIM: eExams have been questioned for its validity and sensitivity, especially for the purpose of evaluating a student at university level, though not for competitive exams. No doubt that on-screen visibility, readability and interpretation during an exam are under skepticism as compared to paper. Thus this paper evaluates the effectiveness of on-screen examinations in comparison to pen and paper exams. METHOD: Both on-paper and on-screen exams were conducted in the month of November 2013, wherein 180 students participated. 31 students were given on-paper exam only, while another 31 students took on-screen exams only. A group of 61 male students were made to take on-paper exam, immediately followed by the on-screen exam with the same set of questions. Another group of 57 girls also took an initial exam on-paper and then the same questions were displayed on screen. The results obtained in each one of the on-paper exams were compared with each one of the on-screen exams. The percentage of marks obtained by the students were graded as "A" for 90-100% marks, "B", "C", "D" and "F" for 80-89%, 70- 79%, 60-69% and 0-60% respectively. The distraction index (DI) was calculated using Hogana (2007) formulae by subtracting the % of students scoring highest grade - the % of students scoring lowest grade. A negative value of DI indicates distraction. RESULTS: The results indicated that there was a remarkable distraction in the on-screen exams with a DI of -33 between on-paper and onscreen exams. The number of students scoring "A" grade reduced drastically from 29% in the on-paper exam to 19% in the on-screen exam. Percentage of students failing ("F" grade) in the exam increased to 26% in the on-screen exam from 3% in the on-paper exam. Further the average time taken to complete the exam was higher in case of on-screen exam (46 minutes) as against on-paper exam (36 minutes). CONCLUSION: We cannot conclusively say that the on-screen exams are not superior over on-paper exams, because our experimental design does not represent the universal student population. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Background and objectives: The University of Calgary's Rural Integrated Community Clerkship anchors final-year medical student education in 9 months of family medicine. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the Family Medicine Preceptor Online Development (FM POD) program, designed to meet the faculty development needs of rural preceptors facing challenges of geographical distribution and time constraints. Methods: The theoretically based program used a blended learning approach, beginning with a face-to-face workshop to strengthen participants' social presence during online interactions to follow. Asynchronous narrated presentations supplied foundational knowledge prior to facilitated synchronous web conferences, where participants shared experiences and co-constructed new knowledge. The program was evaluated using mixed methods, including surveys and focus group discussion. Results: Evaluation tools generated data with high internal consistency reliability; focus group information substantiated and enriched the quantitative survey data. Participants enjoyed collaborating with colleagues and rated their learning experiences highly, reporting meaningful and statistically significant increases in mean comfort with all the precepting skills taught: giving effective feedback, using questions to teach, teaching communications skills, helping learners in difficulty, and making teaching time-efficient. All effect sizes were large. Increased comfort with distance learning technologies was a positive consequence. Conclusions: Results support the applicability of principles of social constructivism, experiential learning, and reflective learning in these participants. The program was highly rated and effectively increased participants' comfort with teaching skills, offering practical off-the-peg modular faculty development in basic teaching skills for distributed faculty. Participants appreciated the flexible delivery format, which course developers found readily adaptable for additional topics.},

abstract={Individual specificity and autonomy of a morally reasoning system is principally attained by means of a constructivist inductive process. Input into such process are moral dilemmata, or their story-like representations; its output are general patterns allowing to classify as moral or immoral even dilemmas which were not represented in the initial 'training' corpus. Moral inference process can be simulated by machine learning algorithms and can be based upon detection and extraction of morally relevant features. Supervised or semi-supervised approaches should be used by those aiming to simulate parent->child or teacher->student morality transfer processes in artificial agents. Pre-existing models of inference-e.g. the grammar inference models well-studied in the domain of computational linguistics-can offer certain inspiration for anyone aiming to deploy a moral induction model. Historical data, mythology or folklore could furnish a basis for the training corpus which could be subsequently significantly extended by a crowdsourcing method exploiting the web-based 'Completely Automated Moral Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart'. Such a CAMTCHA approach could be also useful for evaluation of agent's moral faculties. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The goal of the Progressive Learning Platform (PLP) pilot project is to design and test a platform to teach students how the underlying hardware building blocks relate to organization and architecture of microprocessors. PLP helps students link computer engineering concepts-logic design, microprocessors, computer architecture, embedded systems, compilers, operating systems, and high-level language constructs-in order to be able to construct a deeper understanding of the field of computer engineering. This deeper/richer understanding is expected to improve their knowledge retention, and their ability to assimilate new knowledge when they enter the workforce. PLP is based on the theoretical framework of conceptual blending-how human beings synthesize new knowledge by assimilating and blending what they already know. Since some aspects of this framework are similar to constructivism, PLP-based courses utilize project-based learning, collaborative learning, and an emphasis on students being able to articulate design decisions. To test the effectiveness of PLP, pre/post content tests in a number of courses served as quantitative data while qualitative results were obtained from linguistic analysis of student reflective essays and video transcript of students from lab sessions, and through focus group interviews. The qualitative methods allowed us to stand in the students' shoes and provided deep insights into how they acquired procedural and conceptual knowledge. Our results show that students viewed PLP-based course projects as authentic tasks representative of real engineering projects. The results also showed that the PLP environment served to push students to go back and review concepts from current and previous courses that they would need to apply in their projects. The project has produced a number of products including tutorials for instructors and students, research papers, PLPTool Java code, the PLP instruction set, and the PLP reference implementation in Verilog. All these are available on the PLP website to facilitate easy adoption of PLP at other universities. We are looking for partners to adopt PLP in their courses. The long-term vision for PLP is to be a free and scalable platform for face-to-face and online education in computing worldwide. We are at the initial stage, where our platform is mature and tested at our own sites, but has not been adopted at other institutions. Expected future direction for PLP includes three lines. Visualization tools that use PLP as the underlying engine aim to allow students at all levels (middle-school through practicing professionals) to understand how computers work. We are also working on creating literature, website materials, and tutorials to facilitate PLP's adoption by other instructors. This work will help in the third line of exploration- research on impact of PLP on student learning. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.},

abstract={We present an original approach to introduce Operating Systems concepts to Computer Engineering undergraduate students. These concepts are the basis on which students build a mental model of the whole computer in order to make important design decisions throughout their career. One major challenge in teaching operating systems is the complex, intangible, and nondeterministic nature of an actual computer system containing many cores operating in parallel. We propose a global approach to address this challenge involving a full-scale open source operating system, a carefully designed set of experiments and novel execution visualization tools. In order to deconstruct their preconceptions, students are exposed to phenomena that seem contradictory at first glance, but are the result of the interaction between the microarchitecture, the operating system and the libraries. In the spirit of constructivism, students are invited to observe the efiect of running their own programs as part of a problem solving challenge. Participants can thus observe the duration of underlying system calls and the actual scheduling performed by the operating system which is otherwise hidden. Experiments are proposed to compare the impact of design choices and to lead to improved awareness of performance implications. We describe five problem solving activities that we developed and expose the purpose of each tool used. In the context of the first semester of deployment, we evaluated the activities using a qualitative method. We conducted online surveys and a focus group, and observed a high learning satisfaction level for students.

abstract={Teaching and learning via online delivery is increasingly becoming a norm for many higher education institutions worldwide. This alternative form of learning is characteristically unique and serves a number of purposes - for example, it is cost-effective and convenient for full-time workers who wish to pursue academic studies, part-time. Consequently, the acceptance of this mode has led to a rethinking in pedagogical strategies for educators and researchers alike. Educators and researchers have developed and used a myriad of innovations (e.g., animated pedagogical agents) to stimulate students' interests, intellectual curiosities, and to enhance critical thinking skills. Despite the effectiveness and advantages of online delivery, there are a number of pressing issues for continuing consideration and research development. Notably, one aspect that has received appreciable emphases is the cultivation of a social milieu, online, that may yield characteristics reflective of a traditional, face-to-face (FTF) classroom. Noteworthy of this, for example, is a need for us to create a sense of realism (e.g., dynamic interaction) in students' learning. In a similar manner, there is recognition for educators to emulate a learning climate that binds learners, disregard of time and geographical differences. This feat, in our view, is not simplistic and entails a number of complexities that require continuing conceptualization. The main tenet of this chapter details a brief theoretical overview of online delivery in higher education contexts, and three identified issues that relate dialectically to this pedagogical approach to teaching and learning: (i) experiential feelings of realism; (ii) the facilitation, if possible, of critical thinking skills in an online learning climate; and (iii) the importance of cognitive overload in the presentation of information for online learning. We conclude this chapter with a scoping of recommendations for continuing research development and advancement. There are, in this analysis, a number of pressing issues for educators and researchers to consider - for example, how does the paradigm of online delivery relate to individuals' cognitive processes for learning?. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The large student enrolments and content-dense curricula associated with many undergraduate programs make it difficult for instructors to interact individually with students during lectures to ensure that essential cognitive links are being made and that the course content is fully understood. However, the existence of universal student access to course web sites via the Internet allows the learning environment to be extended well beyond the classroom by providing a wealth of opportunities for interactive learning as well as comprehensive self-testing. This chapter will begin with an exploration of the effective use of online discussion boards and self-testing tools associated with commercially-available course web site platforms such as BlackboardR and the open source course management system, MoodleR. The ability of a discussion forum to promote social constructivism by creating a virtual classroom in which students can ask questions in a risk-free environment, mentor one another, and even work actively together in small groups to explore new concepts and complete assignments will be described. The advantages of instantaneous feedback associated with various online self-testing tools will be recognized. Guiding principles and methods for the creation of animations to support e-learning will be briefly reviewed as will the ability of podcasts to allow students to review lecture highlights anywhere and at any time. Finally, students will be acknowledged as tremendous assets who can recognize learning challenges and assist in developing creative approaches to tackling these hurdles. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={As part one in a series of two, this paper describes the development of a web-based [1] first course in thermodynamics. The course is conceptualized, designed and course materials are introduced to engineering students by a team of practitioner - researchers. The course builds from previous work concerning the development of web-based thermodynamic cycle teaching modules for undergraduate mechanical engineering students [2] and relevant educational literature. The design goals for the online course are that it a) be delivered primarily through asynchronous means and b) fulfill requirements of ABET accredited degree programs in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering as is accomplished by the current face-to-face course. The course design team, consisting of engineering faculty, administrators, and instructional design professionals, used a collaborative approach to move the online course through concept, development to initial introduction. As constructed, example segments ("exemplar modules") were introduced within the current face-to face Thermodynamics I course to witness student reactions and solicit feedback. Once this feedback is filtered back and addressed in the design, the course will be implemented and evaluated in whole within the civil, electrical and mechanical undergraduate engineering programs. The full implementation, evaluation and results will be the focus of a part two paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Learning management systems can play an important role in fostering rich teaching and learning experiences for students and instructors in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) institutions. The levels of sophistication of these platforms vary from one institution to another. Decisions regarding the use of the applications available on the learning management systems ought to be linked to their possible pedagogical benefits. In this regard, this study collected data from lecturers offering online courses in an ODL institution in order to explore their views regarding which applications available in their learning management systems stimulated constructivist and observational learning amongst their students. Using Baviskar, Hartle& Whitney's (2009:543-544) guidelines for constructivist learning and Bandura's (2001:265-299) observational learning, I employed a phenomenological approach to explore the lived experiences of lecturers regarding online applications for constructivist and observational learning. The findings revealed that Discussion forums and Weblogs proved the most suitable online applications for fostering learning in ODL institutions.},

abstract={As new technologies emerge, more and more people depend on them for a variety of purposes. Now more than ever there is a tendency for technological implications to substitute for face-to-face communication and education. In this paper we attempt to investigate whether the usability and pedagogical factors for quality educational platforms meet the expectations of three dominant learning theories of the past century, which, namely are: behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism. We assign specific factors derived from 9 evaluation models to the 3 learning theories. A list of 15 questions was produced to help evaluators in the assessment of the educational software. Then we evaluated 11 educational websites that aim to help anglophone students improve their language skills e.g. through grammar and spelling exercises. The results show the level of correspondence of these educational websites to the learning theories. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={This article describes the design and evaluation of a blended online/face-to-face course completed by more than 6000 learners throughout the United States of America and internationally. The educational impact was monitored using a variety of evaluation strategies. The results, in terms of achieved knowledge and overall satisfaction, indicate that a focus on online instruction combined with face-to-face, hands-on activities showed statistically significant improvement in the learners' understanding of the course material, while also validating the impact of the curriculum in their workplace. As illustrated through the blended course design, this study further showed that online learners with greater improvement in their pre- and posttest scores also exhibited significantly greater likelihood in demonstrating competency in several areas during the hands-on portion of the course. In particular, participants working in the information systems field exhibited the highest mean difference score (21.49) on the pre- and the posttests, while those working in the laboratory had the lowest (12.17). Likewise, the odds that participants who reviewed the course contents sought to further understand their job roles was 58.2 times greater for those in information systems, while it was only 19.0 times greater for laboratory staff, than those who did not review their job roles. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This study tried to ascertain a possible relationship between the number of student moderators (1, 2, and 3), online interactions, and critical thinking of K-12 educators enrolled in an online course that was taught from a constructivist approach. The course topic was use of technology in special education. Social network analysis (SNA) and measures of critical thinking (Newman, Webb, and Cochrane, 1995) were used to research and assess if there was a difference in interaction and critical thinking between 1, 2, or 3 student moderators who facilitated a forum discussion of an assignment in an online course. The same course was repeated over three years. Each year either 1, 2, or 3 students moderated. The analysis indicated more discussion per non-moderating student with the three student moderated group. Using SNA we found that there was only one noticeable difference among the three groups which was in the value of network centralization. Using critical thinking measures the three student moderator group scored higher in five of the eight critical thinking categories. Variations in instructor presence in the online courses may have influenced these findings. © 2013.},

abstract={The present theoretical paper aims to develop a grounded model for designing instructional activities appropriate to e-learning and online learning environments. The suggested model is guided by learning principles of cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism learning principles to help online learners constructing meaningful experiences and moving from knowledge acquisition to knowledge creation process. The proposed model consists of five dynamic and grounded domains that assure the quality of designing and using e-learning activities: • Social Domain; • Technological Domain; • Epistemological Domain; • Psychological domain; and • Pedagogical Domain. Each of these domains needs four types of presences to reflect the design and the application process of e-learning activities. These four presences are: • cognitive presence, • human presence, • psychological presence and • mental presence. Applying the proposed model (STEPP) throughout all online and adaptive e-learning environments may improve the process of designing and developing e-learning activities to be used as mindtools for current and future learners.},

abstract={This paper presents a new virtual environment (VE) which employs a dynamic 3-D model of the classroom. It is based on powerful scientific visualization techniques and can be used as an effective aide in online virtual teaching. The learners enters the virtual model of the classroom as an avatar, navigate through it, zooms in or out as he or she wishes, changes his or her view point and perspective in the virtual world. The virtual reality classroom allows for a learning experience, and facilitates the mental construction of three-dimensional space, where objects are varied and different, but share common features. This paper will also illustrate a VE environment in the form of a classroom developed to deliver any lecture module the instructor wants to teach. The proposed application replicates the classroom environment and enhances the learning through real-time interaction between students and instructor. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This study uses the theoretical framework of social constructivism and Communities of Practice (CoP) in two qualitative case studies that explore the use of wikis in online courses in teacher education to promote collaborative writing, problem-solving, and knowledge construction. The case studies involve data collection in the form of interviews, student products on wiki pages from the two courses, and course feedback. Several themes emerge that can be categorized under the broad headings of community building and collaboration, creative process, professional growth, and technology and the research process. Recommendations are made for educators that may be useful in augmenting their students' e-learning experiences with wikis. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The objective of this paper was to develop a four dimensions dynamic model for designing instructional activities appropriate to electronic and virtual learning environments. The suggested model is guided by learning principles of cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism learning theories in order to help online learners to build and acquire meaningful knowledge and experiences. The proposed model consists of four dynamic dimensions: • Cognitive presence activities; • Psychological presence activities; • Social presence activities; and • Mental presence activities. Cognitive presence activities refer to learner's ability to emerge a cognitive vision regarding the content of learning. The cognitive vision will be the starting point to construct meaningful understanding. Psychological presence activities refer to the learner's ability to construct self awareness and trustworthiness. It will work as psychological schema to decrease the load of learning at distance. Social presence activities refer to the learner's ability to share knowledge with others in a way to construct a community of practice and assure global understanding of learning. Finally, mental presence activities refer to learner's ability to construct mental models that represent knowledge creation. It will help learners to make learning outcomes and experiences transferable. Applying the proposed model will improve the process of developing e-based activities throughout a set of adaptive and dynamic frameworks and guidelines to meet online learner's cognitive, psychological, social and mental presence.},

abstract={What happens when a group of co-learners engage in a continuous lifelong learning community in the context of rapid changes in both the use of ICT in learning and the curriculum? This paper describes a longitudinal study from 1995 to 2010 into the design and use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in an adult e-learning community operating at Paideia University - one of the world's first 'virtual' universities, based in The Netherlands. Working in partnership with Charles Sturt University in Australia, the Paideia study began at a time when all universities were seeking to understand the virtual university model and to discover which path to follow as learning and teaching online was about to change the adult learning landscape. The underlying theoretical framework of social constructivism, was supported at Paideia by its original 'virtual university' curriculum model for dialogue and peer learning techniques. The participants in this study shared a unique desire to seek alternative ways to learn beyond what was offered by conventional practice and universities. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative work has emerged as a hot research topic in Virtual Learning Communities since it may considerably improve the knowledge quality and experience of students. However, this novel approach makes the assessment process challenging (i.e., interactions between virtual students, their achievements, and their profi les have to be properly addressed). The purpose of this paper is to propose a comprehensive Intelligent Tutoring System for Virtual Learning Communities that relies on artifi cial intelligence techniques which are able to manage the specifi cities of the collaborative working groups that arise in this domain. These specifi cities can be summarized in the following four goals: 1) conduct an individualized tracking of every student upon the collected data from his/her profi le and daily work, 2) confi gure the classroom to maximize the performance of all its members, 3) automatically obtain the teacher's feedback about the class operation and possible anomalies, and 4) monitor the working groups behaviour and achievements automatically to redirect their operation when necessary. The framework of the proposed system is described, a proof of concept is presented, and a new virtual student profi le, named as bystander, is identifi ed in preliminary experimentations. © 2013, Australian Computer Society Inc.},

abstract={This article presents the results of a study whose aim was to explore the experiences and perceptions that students, lecturers/tutors and coordinators had of the pedagogical models underpinning online undergraduate programmes in Colombia, and of the application of these models with regard to collaborative work and interaction. The study used qualitative and quantitative techniques to complement and contrast the participants' perceptions. A total of 48 group and individual interviews were conducted, and 288 students and 44 lecturers answered an online survey. The results show that the programmes are based on constructivist principles and tend to use active pedagogies pertaining to that theory. However, the lecturers and students expressed uncertainty about the implementation of collaborative work and the fostering of interaction. © Clelia Pineda Báez, Cristina Hennig and Yasbley Segovia.},

abstract={PurposeConstructivism is a way of knowing where learners collaborate, reflect and use their own experiences to construct new knowledge. This paper aims to evaluate whether an open source Moodle e-learning can deliver an instructional model using constructivist learning theories in an International Baccalaureate chemistry class. Design/methodology/approachA review of the literature shows that students’ learning outcomes online are likely to be better when their actual learning environment closely matches their preferred or ideal learning environment. An online learning survey was administered to the students towards the end of their two-year course and the Wilcoxon signed rank test used to measure the difference between the student's actual and preferred experiences with the online activities that used constructivist theories. FindingsThe findings showed that the activities provided by Moodle do foster a constructivist approach to learning and can provide students with the types of learning experiences they desire. However, their effectiveness is to a large extent dependent on the teacher's role in designing and directing the online learning experience. This is significant because it implies that for an online learning environment to be successful, a strong pedagogical strategy that emphasizes a constructivist approach needs to be consistently emphasized and practiced; having the technology tools available does not guarantee this. Originality/valueThis paper's findings show that constructivism as a learning theory can be translated into practice, and used to design and deliver online learning experiences that provide students with a style of learning they prefer. However, the extent to which this is successful depends on the teacher's role in designing and directing the online learning experience. This is significant because to be successful a strong instructional strategy shaped by the beliefs of the teacher emphasizing a constructivist approach needs to be consistently emphasized. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The theory of learning constructivism indicates that, the success of collaborative learning depends on whether the interpersonal interaction among the group members is adequate. With the strong interactive function, the web provides the effective communication platform for distance learners to learn collaboratively. However, the positive benefits cannot happen automatically in a virtual collaborative learning environment, which call for sound instructional design. This paper focuses on the interpersonal interaction in collaborative learning process. Based on the web-based collaborative learning (Web CL) platform which was designed and implemented by the School of Online Learning of Renmin University of China (CMR), we selected the discussion forum of the undergraduate web course “Dream of the Red Chamber” as the case study and the students who chose the course and the instructor of the course as the respondents. We investigate the “interactive factors” which we assumed may influence the students’ interaction performance, then specifically evaluate the current situation of the “interactive factors” in the discussion forum and identify the weaknesses, finally put forward the enhancing strategies referring to these weaknesses. © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

abstract={The purpose of this article is to report on how Web 2.0 tools in an online information literacy instruction course aligned with ACRL's Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education. A qualitative case study was undertaken on an online graduate course related to information literacy instruction. Data collected included: course activities, assignments, emails, online discussions, and surveys. The educational theory of constructivism and its adherence to reflection, active learning, and social interaction was used to find patterns in the data. Activity theory provided a framework for data analysis and interpretation related to the patterns of activities that took place while students used each Web 2.0 tool. Web 2.0 was found to enhance all five information literacy standards. These standards related to collaboration, information organization, creativity, discussion, and technology education. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

To date most of the work on learning analytics and educational data mining has focused on online courses or cognitive tutors, in which the tasks are more structured and the entirety of interaction happens in front of a computer.

abstract={Modern educational theories, such as collaborative learning, constructivism and inquiry learning, have achieved many successes in real-world applications. Especially, with the development of information technologies, there have been several online collaborative learning platforms in practice. Unfortunately, as these platforms are either too complicated or too expensive, none of them are suitable for us in the practice of STEM+. Moreover, most of these platforms are in English, while we are using Chinese as our teaching language. Using an online collaborative learning platform (OCLP) named Zask, this paper reported our practice in online collaborative learning on course Introduction to Database System. According to the data collected from the first round of our practice, it shows that users' active participations in Zask could benefit for both teaching and learning, and then provide positive effects in education.},

abstract={This article discusses the possibilities that tacit knowledge could provide for social constructivist pedagogies; in particular, pedagogies for online learning. Arguing that the tacit dimension of knowledge is critical for meaning making in situated learning practices and for a community of practice to function, the article considers whether individuals' online identities can be employed as a way to reveal their tacit knowledge. Furthering the discussion, the article analyses tacit knowledge within a community and suggests that social capital theory could productively be employed for utilising tacit knowledge within any given online learning community. © 2013 Copyright Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.},

abstract={College and university faculty in Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) programs are becoming more involved in online course design and instruction. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, examples of several existing FCS online programs are presented. Many online programs are being offered in the United States, and several are offered in an international setting (e.g. British Columbia, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand). Second, four models of education that FCS instructors can draw upon for teaching online are presented. The models are positivism, constructivism, the community of inquiry approach, and experiential learning. Positivism should be utilized when the goal is to teach specific and basic knowledge, which is usually contained in lectures and readings. Other models are more appropriate when the goal is to cultivate students' higher level thinking through dynamic learning processes. Constructivism is based on the assumption that learners are active creators of knowledge and meaning. The community of inquiry approach highlights the importance of building relationships for learning. The experiential learning model involves direct participation in realistic contexts and should be followed with reflection on the general principles of the learning situation. Online teaching strategies, examples, and limitations are presented for each model. © 2013 American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences.},

abstract={This empirical study explores whether authentic tasks designed specifically for deliberately grouped students have an effect on student perception of teaching presence and student cognitive gains. In one library research class offered in an express session online, the instructor grouped students randomly. In a second online library research class, students were deliberately grouped according to major. Assignments were designed and targeted to these two groups with IRB approval. The students were surveyed using a modified Community of Inquiry survey. Analysis of survey results using Chi Square tests indicates that this constructivist approach to teaching and learning is effective for teaching library research methods; there was a statistically significant measure of overall grade achievement in the deliberately grouped class. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={When designing learning and assessment environments it is essential to articulate the underpinning education philosophy, theory, model and learning style support mechanisms that inform their structure and content. We elaborate on original PhD research that articulates the design rationale of authentic medication dosage calculation problem-solving (MDC-PS) learning and diagnostic assessment environments. These environments embody the principles of authenticity, building knowledge and skills and competency assessment and are designed to support development of competence and bridging of the theory-practice gap. Authentic learning and diagnostic assessment environments capture the features and expert practices that are located in real world practice cultures and recreate them in authentic virtual clinical environments. We explore how this provides students with a safe virtual authentic environment to actively experience, practice and undertake MDC-PS learning and assessment activities. We argue that this is integral to the construction and diagnostic assessment of schemata validity (mental constructions and frameworks that are an individual's internal representation of their world), bridging of the theory-practice gap and cognitive and functional competence development. We illustrate these principles through the underpinning pedagogical design of two online virtual authentic learning and diagnostic assessment environments (safeMedicate and eDose™). © 2012.},

abstract={Web 2.0 technologies have a range of possibilities for fostering constructivist learning and observational learning. This is due to the available applications which allow for synchronous and asynchronous interaction and the sharing of knowledge between users. Web 2.0 tools include online social media applications which have potential pedagogical benefits. Despite these potential benefits, there is inadequate utilization of online social media applications in learning management systems for pedagogical purposes. Reasons cited for the limited uptake of online social media applications in learning management systems include the lack of consideration regarding the pedagogical benefits of these applications (Christie & Garrote-Jurado, 2009, pp. 273-279). There is limited information regarding experiences of the use of online social media that foster constructivist and observational learning. Using a qualitative meta-ethnographic approach, this article explores the experiences of students and instructors regarding online social media applications for constructivism and observational learning. Constructivist criteria (Baviskar, Hartle, & Whitney, 2009, pp. 543-544) and observational learning, based on Bandura's (2001, pp. 265-299) social cognitive theory, formed the theoretical grounding for this research. The findings suggest that discussion forums are ideal for the stimulation of constructivism and observational learning in online learning programmes.},

abstract={The ease with which learners evolve online by integrating online communities and social networks, has forced educators to face the sad reality: contrary to other sectors, the use of Information and Communication Technology has still not effectively enhanced or promoted the teaching and learning processes as desired. Moreover, the high percentage of distant learners abandoning their studies confirms the need of exploiting ICT not only as a communication tool but more importantly, as a supportive and pedagogical tool. It is therefore imperative to understand how learners interact online. What are the supports they need? What are the factors which help them persist in their studies? Are online processes similar to the ones taking place in classroom? Those requirements are necessary input to educational information systems. This paper which is based on a doctoral research, investigates on the learning processes of ten learners enrolled in a completely online masters' course. More specifically, this research relates to the supports the learners seek online during the tutor-learners and learner-learners interactions exchanged via the chat tool in an e-campus. As methodology, content analysis of their logged textual interactions was done using the qualitative analysis based on the activity theory of Engeström. The 4583 lines of interactions analyzed, reveal that in both types of meetings (with or without their tutor), learners interacted, collaborated and progressed online by making sure that they understood fully their roles and the tasks that are expected from them. Results revealed that the focus of their interactions was not fully centered on the cognitive or meta-cognitive issues as one would expect during such discussions relating to course materials and problem based assignments. Moreover, learners expected prompt feedback from their tutor in order to clarify doubts and uncertainties that subsist online. As mature learners enrolled on a completely distance course, they proved to be autonomous, responsible and having the capacity to complete successfully their assignment with basic cognitive types of interactions. Socio-constructivism approach deployed has proved to be supporting the learners pedagogically and psychologically. Thus, tutors are required to play even more challenging and leadership roles online but it is observed that they have limitations in understanding the progress of their learners. Peer supports have been found to be an important factor to help learners persist in their studies. This model, comprising of a successful mixture of technology and pedagogy, has contributed in removing geographical barriers, allowing also for both the northern and southern hemisphere countries to benefit from this model. This learning environment along with the learning strategies and human supports should continue to evolve based on the changing requirements of individuals in online communities.},

Students in a first year composition course were tasked with taking lecture notes during class solely utilizing online course software, specifically the chat room feature. An analysis of the chat transcript revealed how students organically situated knowledge construction in a virtual context. Examining the individual and group thought processes of the students, along with the questions that they asked, provided the instructor with an avenue for extended classroom conversation and future lesson planning. Additionally, student feedback and participation in the chat room has established the parameters for an extended research project into the tenants of constructivism in virtual learning environments.},

abstract={Recent research has focused on the development of effective online problem based learning (PBL). However, there is a need for research to examine experiences of online PBL in those new to online learning. This study used a single module blended approach to examine the student experience of online PBL in a group of postgraduates new to online learning. This employed one problem scenario for each group (four students per group) as the central component of the module. Asynchronous discussion boards were used to facilitate the learning process with other forms of delivery used as appropriate. Focus group interviews revealed that students believed online PBL developed skills related to employability and information retrieval/evaluation. Online PBL was seen as beneficial for developing ideas and critiquing information. However, the artificial nature of the discussion board space was a barrier for some students, as was anxiety about online participation in the PBL tasks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper reports about a study of a collaborative learning scenario in university education within the subject of e-business. In business education advanced collaboration skills and media literacy are important for surviving in a globalized business where virtual communication between enterprises is part of the day-to-day business. To facilitate communication and collaboration between partners who work in different places at different schedules and even in different time zones, tools of web 2.0 are adequate in supporting this process. Especially working together with Wiki and similar collaborative Web-Tools satisfies asynchronous communication processes because all group members can trace changes, view the history of their colleagues work, and communicate about it. To transform these global working situations into higher education, a learning scenario was created where hundreds of students from two universities in Germany and Austria worked together in small interregional learning groups. Participating students had to collaborate virtually to prepare and report a shared case study online. The e-business case study had to be documented in a Wiki, and presented in the classroom of each university. When working together, learners used different tools for close virtual collaboration around a Wiki toolset such as forum, chat, video conferencing and other social media. Based on the didactical concept of moderate constructivism that should be best implemented by editing realistic problems and project tasks as well as cooperative learning, the case study method was chosen for collaboration. Students applied given case studies (e.g. from Harvard Business Review) or they worked out a business case from their own experience, which covered a range of upcoming e-business topics. An attending evaluation study with around 270 participants from two universities could show several substantive effects like • Tremendous influence of interregional group work for media competencies • Hidden social aspects and conflict potential • Scenario design and different media usage • Teaching effort vs. learning outcome of such a scenario • Learning impact for different student groups and learning styles: Who benefits most from such a learning scenario? Collaborative learning with a Web 2.0 tool like a Wiki in combination with the case study method can be quite effective in higher education settings. Methodical design of a learning scenario and choosing the media toolset is worth to plan carefully. Especially the presentation and debriefing requires a personal reflection of the case study itself and virtual collaboration about it in several groups. However this resulted in a high professional and social learning outcome on the part of the individual students. The online survey collected data from student groups who worked together in interuniversity or regional teams on case studies within the subject area e-business. The findings of this study show several interesting aspects of media usage and how students benefited from this learning scenario.},

abstract={This paper describes an exploratory study observing the use of Minecraft (a popular sandbox style online video game environment) in a high school English literature classroom. We use Piaget and Inhelder's (1969) constructivist theories about the formal operational stage of development to interpret the concepts of plot and characterization in three student produced films that were created within the game environment. We claim that Minecraft can be used as a tool to assist in the cognitive development of its players through the practice of constructed learning. Minecraft's popularity implies that this type of knowledge production is preferred by youth for informal learning, and has vast implications for educational curricula.},

abstract={Learners now have to function in an ever changing world, and so need to be competent for it. Professional learning/ workplace learning has to be competency oriented. At the same time the learning activities have to be constructivism based. On distance learning is becoming a priority. We saw the evolution from e-learning to blended learning. In the new model of blended learning, the learning process is competency directed and is composed of constructivism based learning activities, some of them face to face activities and others being online activities. A blended e-learning model is developed for on distance learners and professional learners. Also a hybrid model for mixing regular students and professionals or distance students is developed. © 2012 IEEE.},

As a possible way of achieving this objective, we present the online Community of Practice developed and presently being in trial at the Institute for Work Based Learning, Middlesex University. In this paper, we describe our approach for developing and utilising of this Community of Practice. We will describe the benefits of the educational software tools we have used in the implementation process. Through case studies we will present two ways in which the online Community of Practice is being currently applied. We will outline the main advantages and some challenges of using the newly created Community of Practice.},

abstract={This chapter explores the underlying theoretical principles that provided the basis for the design and implementation of a professional development program for informatics teachers in Greece. A blended learning model was adopted combining live workshop meetings, face-to-face in-lab training sessions and online videoconferencing sessions. The framework of constructivism and experiential learning was used as a theoretical rationale for the combination of face-to-face activities with online learning experiences. It is shown that a blended learning design based on the principles of constructivism and experiential learning pedagogy can provide vital tools for the creation of an active environment for informatics teachers' professional development. Also, it appears that a promising direction for further investigation, in terms of improving the learning outcome based on the same theoretical principles, is the more detailed design of the sequence of learning activities and a closer look at the development of communities of practice among teachers. © 2012, IGI Global.},

This tool takes advantage of constructivism and cooperative learning, methodologies that should prevail in the engineer's developing their capacity to problematize reality and focusing problems solving strategies to raise, such as problem identification, search of feasible solutions, and prioritization of them according to requirements and available resources. With these parameters set, it is possible to determine the time length of the Webquest and then to proceed to create its components: 1) Introduction, 2) Task, 3) Instructions or processes; 4) Resources, 5) Evaluation and 6) Conclusions, by using one of the many implementation alternatives available online. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of the first in a series of e-learning courses intended to influence the professional practices of 200+ teachers in 15 locations across a western state. The course, anchored in a socially constructed view of learning, combined the use of interactive video, WebCT, and on-site discussion groups to implement research-based practices in literacy. Outcomes of the authors' experiences in designing the course suggest the need to understand the nature of teachers' professional knowledge, the implications of socially constructed professional development, and the demands of learning in a digital environment. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={This book centers on several key areas of social engagement and social learning in higher education today, including social networking platforms and e-portfolios. In addition to these Web 2.0 technologies, rapid improvements in related communication technologies (e.g., broadband services, wireless, mobile phones, and tablets) have also provided the necessary infrastructure components by which educators implement innovative teaching and learning practices on a larger scale, in a more reliable manner, and in a more targeted fashion. These technologies are also transforming our views of what it means to learn in an increasingly globalized, interconnected, and pluralistic world. The authors have presented several perspectives on how to use social networking tools to better engage learners in more meaningful and authentic learning activities. Social networking sites like Facebook are not a panacea for effective learning, but they do provide instructors and students with a convenient platform for enhancing the teaching and learning process. Instructors also play an important part in modeling proper online behavior through their presence on the platform and their interaction with their students. However, these tools are only one piece of the learning puzzle. The ultimate goal is to enable students to become lifelong learners and to instill in them a high value for learning that matures over their lifetime. As such, these tools can be used to better engage students more deeply in authentic and personally meaningful learning experiences. Contextualizing grammar in second language (L2) classrooms implies making grammar constructs relevant to the learners' world; affording learners the opportunities to better comprehend and apply these concepts in their own milieus. This instructional design (ID) has been devised to contextualize grammar and to explore learner engagement of pre-service English teachers through Computer-Aided Learning (CAL) and Taskbased Learning (TBL) in a technology-driven learning environment. CAL encompasses technology-aided discussions, multi-media presentations, online tests and exercises, and social media deployment. TBL, on the other hand, contextualizes grammar using technology and social network in planning, executing, and presenting four assigned tasks: picture essay, brochure design, dialogue composition, and comic strips illustration. Facebook is the e-portfolio of the class, archiving all group and individual output. The CAL-TBL tandem is propelled by group initiatives and class collaboration evident in group discussions and planning, microteaching, task presentations, peer reviews, and self-evaluations. These initiatives engage learners; empowering students to collaboratively take active part and responsibility for their own learning. The three-hour-class meets every week in a computer laboratory. The post-semester feedback and online poll course design review as well as the University Course Evaluation comments have shown that the ID, from the learners' perspective, is effective in contextualizing grammar and in engaging learners.

abstract={International students have become an important part of many universities, both through the income they provide and the diversity they bring to student populations. Studying in a foreign country can be challenging, requiring students to adapt to unfamiliar educational cultures. With the integration of online technologies into higher education, this can raise an additional set of challenges. This paper presents research that explored Chinese international students' experiences of studying online at an Australian university, drawing on qualitative data collected from focus groups and interviews with Chinese students, interviews with their Australian teachers and course documentation. The findings indicate a strong culture clash between these students' educational dispositions, shaped by their previous learning experiences in China, and the online pedagogic practices, which were underpinned by a constructivist approach. This resulted in detrimental educational and psychological consequences, with participants reporting limited development of their knowledge, and feelings of isolation and anomie. The findings suggest that investigating the interplay between learners' prior and current educational experiences is important in understanding how students experience teaching practices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Teaching complex learning domains such as cultural awareness relies on individual perspectives. In this paper we present the process and technology to develop an online system to share multiple experiences of Aboriginal Culture in NSW, Australia within a social-constructivist framework. The focus of the material is the Kinship system used for thousands of years in this region. This topic exemplifies the knowledge used to maintain societies and provides the setting for social conflict with the non-Aboriginal people who came here in recent history. We are using stories from the community to augment the learning material. Using innovative web services, teachers can select the stories that are relevant to their course, and link these within a range of scenarios being developed. The scenarios enable students to select the way they relate to the characters, listen to their stories, and become aware of their own role in the community. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Despite the turmoil of a worldwide economic crisis, the health sector remains largely understaffed, and the nursing shortage represents a major issue that jeopardizes graduate nursing education. Access to education remains a challenge, particularly in rural and remote areas. This article reports the process of developing an asynchronous online qualitative research course. This online course was piloted among 16 interdisciplinary students. Participants agreed that experiential learning was useful to understand the intricacies of qualitative research. Within this constructivist approach, students were immersed in real-life experiences, which focused on the development of skills applicable to qualitative research. Based on the findings, we suggest that constructivism and the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model (a four-part approach for fostering the development of complex skills) represent valuable ontological and pedagogical approaches that can be used in online courses.Triangulating these two approaches is also congruent with the student-centered philosophy that underpins nursing graduate programs. © SLACK Incorporated.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to develop and implement a learning theory-based EFL(English as a Foreign Language) e-tutoring platform to help EFL learners develop English language skills in their own pace. The online e-tutoring platform was designed based on learning theories of constructivism, situated learning theory, cooperative learning, and self-regulated learning. It is intended that the online e-tutoring platform can provide an opportunity for e-tutors to facilitate each individual EFL learner to develop his/her language skills. A group of 25 six graders participated in the 20 week e-tutoring program via the online EFL e-tutoring platform. Analysis of Results from the participants' achievement tests and feedback from the e-tutors helped to inform future improvements of e-tutoring programs. Recommendations for platform improvements were also provided. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) have become increasingly popular in educational settings and the role of 3D content is becoming more and more important. Still, there are many challenges in this area, such as lack of empirical studies that provide design for educational activities in 3D CVEs and lack of norms of how to support and assess learning in with such technology. The purpose of this paper is to address these challenges by discussing the use of a 3D CVE in a university course for three years and suggesting practical guidelines based on the data from observations. The main research question of the discussion in this paper is: How to facilitate learning by means of educational visualizations in 3D CVEs? The authors discuss data from several explorative case studies conducted within the Cooperation Technology course at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In these case studies, the authors focused on a particular type of collaborative work with 3D content - educational visualizations. Groups of students were asked to build creative visualizations of a certain topic (e.g. a research project or a curriculum topic) and present the construction to the public. The data were collected from the direct observation of students' activities online, virtual artefacts, such as chat log and 3D constructions, and users' feedback in a form of group essays or blogs. Following the analysis of these data, the authors introduce an original methodology for facilitating collaborative work with 3D content in an educational context and provide a characterization framework - Typology of 3D Content and Visualization Means, which can be used together with the methodology for analysing constructions in 3D CVEs. Constructionism and social constructivism were used as a theoretical grounding. Although the research method applied has certain limitations related to the settings of the conducted studies, such as observing the same course each year and impossibility of having a control group, this research still provides important insights, as it identifies overall tendencies in conducting educational activities in 3D CVEs. The suggested methodology was developed for teachers, instructors, and technicians. It can be used as a guideline for organizing educational activities using collaborative work with 3D content. Results of the authors' research indicate that the methodology suggested in the paper benefits structuring and planning of educational visualizations in 3D CVEs. It can be considered as a contribution to the field, as it helps to fill the gap in practical guidelines for the advanced use of 3D CVEs in educational settings. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article presents the development and implementation of a wiki-based application for the delivery of educational content in dentistry. The Dental Procedure Education System (DPES) is a new web application that uses SharePoint to combine online collaborative authoring characteristic of wiki spaces with instructional video documentaries. Harnessing the wiki's versatility, DPES offers faculty members an avenue to develop an authoritative source of information for both students, through DPES Pro, and the public at large, through DPES Public. Principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning, constructivist theory, and collaborative writing were employed in the development of DPES. An authoring protocol, with a clearly defined sequence of steps, was established in order to keep the production of the DPES procedures consistent and predictable. Initial, anecdotal user reports indicate that DPES is well received among dental students and faculty members. Expected outcomes and benefits of DPES use are discussed, and directions for research are proposed.},

abstract={In this study we present an overview of the undergraduate blended Physics course that has been supported by the Moodle platform. The course that has been applied is a basic physics course for primary student teachers. The aim of Moodle is to create an online learning environment which helps students to have a virtual space where they can share knowledge through different kinds of supervised activities, chats and forums. Students have to enter Moodle and they have participated activities that have been offered by the instructor after the lesson every week. After the study, results have shown that teacher candidates using Moodle processing have positive thoughts about the course. In the study, it has been emphasized views of prospective primary teachers about MOODLE in some subjects of physics. Students are challenged to doing research. Prospective teachers tend to use this method in their professional life; therefore, it is recommend that offering challenging possibilities to them about their using. It is recommended that this application is become widespread in education (especially higher education in Turkey).},

abstract={This paper is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in using online environments to provoke student enquiry in any discipline in higher education. Using a Community of Enquiry model that tackles the pedagogical weaknesses in constructivism, we explain why online environments are so effective in engaging students actively in a learning process that meets the requirements of an academic context. From this perspective, we are able to offer concrete advice on how to design an online environment that will provoke student-enquiry. We explain why a social presence is important in the establishment of a Community of Enquiry and we also align particular web technologies to the various stages in the enquiry process and the students’ achievement of a unit’s learning outcomes. The reader will develop a better understanding of community of enquiry in higher education, and how to use web technologies to provoke enquiry in an online environment. © 2012 Fiona Nicolson & Mitch Parsell.},

abstract={Distance learning technologies offer a multitude of ways to build interaction into online courses to support learning. Based on social constructivism theory, this study explored which types of interaction are most predictive of students' sense of community in online graduate courses at a regional comprehensive university. Surveys were used to measure sense of community and the frequency and importance of nine learner-learner interactions. Interactions that were most predictive of sense of community were introductions, collaborative group projects, sharing personal experiences, entire class discussions, and exchanging resources. The interaction that offered the highest payoff to instructors was exchanging resources. The article discusses implications for online course design.},

abstract={Teaching and Learning in the Digital Age is for all those interested in considering the impact of emerging digital technologies on teaching and learning. it explores the concept of a digital age and perspectives of knowledge, pedagogy and practice within a digital context.
By examining teaching with digital technologies through new learning theories cognisant of the digital age, it aims to both advance thinking and offer strategies for teaching technology-savvy students that will enable meaningful learning experiences.
Illustrated throughout with case studies from across the subjects and the age range, key issues considered include:
• how young people create and share knowledge both in and beyond the classroom and how current and new pedagogies can support this level of achievement
• the use of complexity theory as a framework to explore teaching in the digital age
• the way learning occurs – one way exchanges, online and face-to-face interactions, learning within a framework of constructivism, and in communities
• what we mean by critical thinking, why it is important in a digital age, and how this can occur in the context of learning
• how students can create knowledge through a variety of teaching and learning activities, and how the knowledge being created can be shared, critiqued and evaluated.
With an emphasis throughout on what it means for practice, this book aims to improve understanding of how learning theories currently work and can evolve in the future to promote truly effective learning in the digital age. it is essential reading for all teachers, student teachers, school leaders, those engaged in Masters’ Level work, as well as students on Education Studies courses. © 2012 Louise Starkey.

abstract={In many educational institutions today, online assessment systems are being used to evaluate student knowledge and understanding. Unfortunately, these systems often only allow teachers to ask questions in the form of multiple choice or free text responses. While these question types have value, they are either too limited to gain insight into student understanding (multiple choice responses) or too time-consuming because they need to be evaluated by the teacher (free text responses). This paper gives an overview of BeSocratic, a robust pedagogical tool that allows teachers to probe student understanding automatically using a variety of question types. These question types focus on problems with freeform answers that are structured well-enough to allow automatic evaluation. Furthermore by recording each student's work, BeSocratic allows teachers and researchers to replay student submissions and potentially gain deeper insight into a student's thought process through post analysis. © 2012 IADIS.},

abstract={The new instructional design model (Isman - 2011) aims at planing, developing, implementing, evaluating, andorganizing full learning activities effectively to ensure competent performance by students. The theoreticalfoundation of this model comes from behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism views. And it's based onactive learning. During teaching and learning activities, learner is active and uses cognitive learning to constructnew knowledge. To construct new knowledge, educational technology materials are used. These materials areconnected with goals and objectives. This study examines the effectiveness of the instructional design model(Isman - 2011) in developing the students teaching skills (Planning Teaching Domain) by redesign "Generalteaching methods course - curr 233-", which taught to the sixth level students at teachers' college, King SaudUniversity. The sample of the study consisted of 80 students that enrolled in the second semester 2010/2011,they were divided into two groups of 40 students each, (an experimental group and a control group). The resultcomes by administered pre- post teaching skills test to find out the model has strong effectiveness in achievingthe research aims especially in developing the student teaching skills. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={Purpose – The current paper focuses on the increasing demand for generic competences both from governments and industries. Despite this fact, there is insufficient awareness and information in education systems on how to equip graduates with appropriate generic competences for the world of work and citizenship. This is even more complicated in online virtual learning programmes where face-to-face communication is excluded in the design and implementation of the programme curriculum. The paper seeks to question if it is possible to develop generic competences in an online virtual learning environment. Design/methodology/approach – For this purpose, the research develops a theoretical framework based on the generic competences, learning content, learning support and learning activities. The paper argues that an online virtual learning curriculum design differs from a traditional face-to-face classroom environment in terms of learning content, learning activities and nature of learning support. Taking these elements in designing online virtual learning programme would promote acquisition of generic competences among the students. Findings – The research examines possibilities of the online virtual learning platform ALUD (Aprendizaje en Linea de la Universidad de Deusto) at the University of Deusto, Spain, to develop generic competences online. The research demonstrates opportunities of the online virtual learning platform ALUD to develop and practice generic competences among students even without actual and traditional face-to-face educational communication. Originality/value – The paper explores generic competence development through the online virtual learning platform ALUD at the University of Deusto, Spain. It examines possibilities of online education platform of the University of Deusto to produce alignment between what is espoused through the curriculum, what is enacted and how students experience learning through a virtual learning programme in order to develop their generic competences online. The paper argues that the virtual learning platform ALUD provides many opportunities for learners to develop and practise their generic competences even without actual and traditional face-to-face educational programmes. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={This paper analyses how an elementary-level future school in Singapore implements and uses various open-source online platforms, which are easily available online and could be implemented with minimal software cost, for the purpose of teaching and learning. Online platforms have the potential to facilitate students' engagement for independent and collaborative learning, enhance student-teacher interactions, and develop students' technological skills. A framework is constructed to facilitate the conceptualisation of the various pedagogical approaches for learning using such online platforms - learning from and with technology is proposed. Learning from technology leans itself more towards the didactic and behaviouristic theories whereas learning with technology has its origin from the constructivism and social constructivism paradigms. In addition, both the didactic and constructivist pedagogical approaches are applicable for online learning as they could be used to achieve different outcomes depending on the learning objectives. Implicit in the findings is also the importance of the teachers' commitment and competencies and good infrastructural and technical support in the use of technologies for teaching and learning in an educational setting. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In this paper the researchers reflect on the use of various communication technologies from the first online offering of our introductory thermodynamics course. The asynchronous (i.e., forums) and synchronous communication technologies such as Centra" were employed for instruction and explication of useful feedback and self-explanation to promote students' collaboration. The instructors outline the types of questions used in these guided activities that challenged students to search for multiple ways to demonstrate their conceptual understanding of very fundamental physical notions. The discussion in this paper outlines ways to improve forum questions, instructor' feedback, and the frequency of the feedback to improve students' metacognitive strategies in learning and the application of the course material. The observational data are also examined to note if there were any differences in forum contributions online versus students' contributions in a face-to-face class. This paper provides a platform for research about learning and evaluation of instruction in abstract engineering courses in an online environment. The study is significant and of interest to faculty and administrators who have taught courses in traditional classrooms and who are now considering online teaching to increase access to engineering education.

The system (1) provides structured individual ePortfolios and hyperlinks that enable students to quickly locate useful information created by others in various ways, (2) features user-friendly, intelligent search capabilities making it easy to search for keywords and identify other bright students (based on past reports, test scores, peer assessment, and so on), and (3) supports an array of assessment techniques at all levels-tests, peer assessments, self assessments, instructor-designated best practices, ability to input comments from other students, hyperlinks-that not only encourage students to reflect upon their own learning but can be used to quickly identify the best students who consistently do excellent work. Actual trial use of the system demonstrates that it does indeed promote learning from others, and supports sustainability of learning and deeper robust acquisition of knowledge; not superficial learning based on memorization. © 2011 IADIS.},

abstract={Teachers' Forum is now an integrated part of a blended counselling and learning system at the University of Nordland. This forum is a contribution towards developing the school as a learning organisation. The Teachers' Forum offers teachers the opportunity to work in professional and collaborative learning communities without having to reveal their identity. This gives the chance to admit to difficulties, to ask questions anonymously and to experience the social support and personal advantages in a learning community. They will realise that others have had to face the same or similar problems and maybe they have learned how to solve their problems. This may help to ease the pressure on the involved teacher, thereby enabling him to deal with his problem in a more professional manner. Our intentions are to explore possibilities and restrictions of web-based problem solving. What are web-based counsellors doing? The psychological and philosophical concepts that have informed the development of the three major theoretical approaches to counselling - constructivism, person-centred and problem-based theories - will be used in this paper. In this paper we reflect on exploring text-based blended counselling. The paper is an opportunity to clarify experiences about online counselling, the strengths it brings to the teacher's work and the need for personal support that has to be addressed in problematic situations. Based on reading, experiences and counselling texts, this discussion relates to theory and assumptions about problem solving, teacher's needs and issues. The purpose of the paper is also to provide a forum from which we can begin to articulate particular approaches to counselling. Assuming that we grow and change, the paper provides a starting point for what we hold to be important, what we are like as people and how we might see ourselves as counsellors. In this context they assist teachers in relation to knowledge building, personal and practical problem solutions, interpersonal relationships, the workplace and even health problems. They are also trained to assist teachers and schools experiencing both more acute and chronic conflicts and crises. Web-based counsellors may use a wide variety of techniques and support approaches - even therapeutic ones. These will vary and will be tailored to meet the personal needs of the client. In the context of our study, therapeutic approaches have not been heavily used and are not emphasised. © 2011 IADIS.},

abstract={Sharing knowledge through collaboration and community using distance learning tools is an important component of today's 21 st century education. Distance learning is growing in educational institutions worldwide, and instructors are developing enhanced teaching strategies focused on incorporating metacommunication that engages and empowers students in their quest for understanding. This chapter focuses on knowledge building through interactivity, social engagement, and communication technologies in a distance learning environment. Emphasis is placed on online collaboration and community building to encourage collaborative learning and ultimately knowledge acquisition. Theoretical constructs surrounding social constructivism and practical application to instruction are provided to the reader to enhance a distance learning course using meta-communication strategies. © 2012, IGI Global.},

abstract={Since the prevalence of virtual worlds in society has grown exponentially in recent years and virtual worlds have demonstrated an incredible power to engage participants in ways in which traditional education has not, virtual worlds provide us an excellent opportunity to create engaging, collaborative, and academically challenging learning situations. Also, given the new media literacy of many of younger students, we in higher education are in many ways meeting them where they already areyor should be. By integrating virtual worlds into instruction, the Virtual Education Research Group (VERG) at Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts provides students with these collaborative experiences. Through a sustained community of practice and experimentation with a variety of virtual world platforms including ActiveWorlds, World of Warcraft, Warhammer, City of Heroes Architect, Forbidden City, and Second Life, some general principles and specific learning activities emerge for instructors integrating virtual worlds into the classroom. The basic concepts of connecting with technical and administrative support, choosing a world with thematic connections to your subject, creating scheduled opportunities to play and learn together, and committing to providing a strong online presence have been expanded upon to create a flexible model that can be applied across disciplines. Through the work of VERG at Middlesex Community College, virtual worlds are now used in a variety of instructional disciplines, ranging from humanities to psychology to business. Several case studies illustrating unique and effective practices are provided. Copyright © 2011 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.},

abstract={In 2002 Arcada began an experiment that aimed to develop a learning laboratory in the form of a virtual culture embodied in an online world. This chapter examines how and why this was attempted, the opportunities that it offered, and the reasons why the experiment was ended. It draws from interviews with staff and students, both during and after the project, as well as papers and reports written as the project evolved. Marinetta Ombro was designed to explore several possibilities inherent in online worlds, other than their use as "virtual classrooms" - possibilities that were intended to derive a pedagogical approach that drew from the core features of multiuser worlds, rather than ignoring them. These included the ever-present possibility of creative disruption. The chapter presents a case study that focuses on an approach to virtuality that was genuinely challenging and innovative. It offers practical and theoretical insights, including a sample learning plan, for educators wishing to explore virtual worlds as well as those wishing to reimagine their current work.

abstract={This paper describes the Online Slang Open Book project (www.wikislang.org) we developed based on MediaWiki (www.MediaWiki.org). The project was designed to help ESL learners to study English slang in an authentic context and help them appreciate the cultural differences between English and their mother languages. This study's results suggest that a Wiki is an effective tool to improve the ESL learning process and learners tend to collaborative well in Wikis. The implication of the project and the future work are discussed at the end. © Common Ground, Jerry Li, Wenting Ma, Cai Qing, Michele Secret, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine Socratic dialogue in asynchronous online discussions in relation to constructivism. The links between theory and practice in teaching are to be discussed whilst tracing the origins of Socratic dialogue and recent trends and use of seminar in research based institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Many online degree courses employ asynchronous discussions where the teacher, acting as a moderator, is seen as the guide on the side rather than the sage on the stage. Such an approach, employing collaborative learning, is often described as constructivist. Practitioners may see the term constructivist as simply a convenient label to describe a range of effective teaching practices. Even when it is said that knowledge is constructed, this may be viewed as little more than a metaphor. There are however, behind these labels, epistemological theories such as radical constructivism and social constructivism which pose serious challenges to traditional views that perception is guided by contact with an independent reality and that science involves a search for objective truth. Many significant philosophical objections can be raised against these theories. The links between the theory and teaching practices of proven value are tenuous. There is an alternative explanation of the origins of teaching practices associated with asynchronous discussions. Findings: Asynchronous discussion makes it possible for all students to make an initial written contribution based on both research and industry experience, as well as an extensive participation in a written debate. The relative ease of assessing contributions to a written debate helps overcome the problem of the seminar where only one person may get credit for his or her contribution. Contributions can to a great extent be made when it is convenient for both moderator and students. Research limitations/implications: The present study has considered the case of one institution; it will be useful to examine it for many. Practical implications: Asynchronous online discussion is one of the highest forms of Socratic dialogue. Originality/value: This is a different approach to the traditional belief and new ideas for consideration are presented. The Socratic dialogue has been developed as both an oral and written tradition from the works of authors like Plato, through to the development of the medieval university with its disputations and oral examinations, the introduction of seminars in research based universities inspired by Humboldt, the development of scholarly journals, and on to the asynchronous online discussions in the era of the Web. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social Network Sites such as Facebook are being now used by many academics for learning purposes, taking into account studies that report that a majority of young students spend more time in socially related online activities when compared to time in classroom. In online education there are mature models for creating and conducting learning experiences, one of them is the 5 stage e-Moderation model. In this study we created an experience of doing e-Moderation of a learning process in Facebook. At the same time a comparison of interactions and learning between Facebook and traditional online discussion forums in a learning management system is performed. The participants of the course setting are university professors from diverse countries in Latin- America. Outlined are findings in organization of learning activities, new social motivation artifacts and intrinsic social behaviors, information exchange difficulties, enhanced and increased interaction, positive knowledge construction, critical thinking and reflection development, therefore leading the study results into creating effective e-Moderation learning activities in Social Network Sites.},

abstract={Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Taiwan often use an outdated lecture-memorization methodology resulting in low motivation, confidence, and ability on the part of students. Innovative educators are exploring use of technology, such as videoconferences with native speakers, to enrich the classroom; however few guidelines have been developed for effective videoconference instructional design. This study used a survey methodology, Exploratory Factor Analysis, and Structural Equation Modeling to examine which elements of learning via videoconferencing most beneficially affect motivation, confidence, and ability. The study found that long-term changes in ability are best predicted by enjoyment of the learning experience. The data also suggested that even a small amount of authentic interaction in English made students more comfortable in applying their skills, more confident in what they learned, and more inspired to make global, cross-cultural connections. Therefore, EFL instructors should strive to use student-centered active learning and to offer their students interactions with native speakers, including interactions via distance technology. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a web application composed of a set of tools and graphical user interfaces. This application aims at simplifying learning design and enhancing effective learning of distant lab work activities, in the field of computer education. This work is based on the educational concepts of the social constructivism theory, which focuses on the crucial role of collaboration and tutoring during online learning activities. Experiments' design and deployment are supported by an intuitive web application that graphically builds their components and features. Another web interface dedicated to education and based on the "Cockpit" model was developed. Learners and tutors are able to remotely control the whole experiment as well as each of its components, while being aware, both in real and delayed time, of the activities performed by others. Additional controls are provided to tutors in order to allow them to quickly identify difficulties and blocking situations that learners are facing. This web application is well integrated and available in a learning management system, as any traditional learning activity. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={With the development of Web 2.0 technologies, online museums generally attract online visitors to constructivism study which is related but not limited to the physical experience in a real museum. Constructivism study theory indicates that the study will be happened most effectively when learners create physical artifacts or discuss with fellow learners around certain topics or knowledge. In this paper, we address integrating social media with online museum, forming the circle of attracting users, supporting communication, accumulating knowledge, disseminating knowledge via social media and then attracting more users. During this circle, facilitate users' constructivism study by providing contextual knowledge relevant to a certain collection and make learning be a social activity via social media.},

abstract={The intricate crafting of online educational systems lie within three principal activities: Design of the system, implementation, and proper post-implementation assessment. There is not enough knowledge or experience in all regards. Efficient execution of these three major activities necessi-tates the use of design and pedagogical models to achieve cost and time efficiency, as well as high pedagogical quality. Models represent a structured approach to analysis and promote quanti-fiable feedback that can be monitored. Components of an online educational system would bene-fit from a design process. Similarly, utilization of the online educational system would benefit from a structured approach to design, implementation, and student's assessment. Following the technology adoption theory, understanding individual's behavior towards technology usage would focus on instrumental beliefs driving intentions. However, this may not be the case with online educational systems because the context and setup is significantly different from previous technology adoption studies. Therefore, the implementation of an online educational system should be designed based on established pedagogical principles, and once developed the assess-ment of students' behavior should be monitored using management information systems method-ology. In this paper, we present the design of an online education system, and the experience of the stu-dents using the system. A survey methodology approach is followed and assessment results are discussed. The technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior were used to identify significant constructs as antecedents to intentions. Scale validation for both models indi-cates that the operational measures have acceptable psychometric properties. Confirmatory factor analysis supports both models. Structural equation analysis provides evidence for the superiority of the theory of planned behavior in explaining students' behavior towards educational online systems. Limitation, implications, design recommendations, and suggestions for future research are then discussed.},

abstract={Institutes of higher education are feeling more and more pressure to cut costs whenever possible. Increasing section sizes and offering online versions of courses is sometimes seen as the quick fix to the problem, a situation particularly evident in many core courses populated by a wide array of students who are not majoring in that specific field. How can instructors of these courses create an environment that engages and draws these large groups of non-majors into learning and understanding the core knowledge and skills presented in the class? The authors of this paper present a redesign of, and initial findings from, a reworked introductory computer science class that seeks to address this question through the use of active, communication focused, and student-centric techniques, materials, and technologies. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={This article argues for a flexible model of learning for adults which allows them to make choices and contextualise their learning in a manner appropriate to their own professional practice whilst also developing as a member of a learning community. It presents a design based around online 'learning activities' which draws on ideas of constructivism, collaborative learning and reflective practice. The model was developed for adult learning in Higher Education, and has been adapted and extended to a number of different programmes. Implementation of the model for the Teaching Qualification (Further Education) has been the subject of an interpretative evaluation using a multiple methods approach. Learners' experiences of this programme together with issues associated with the application of the model to other programmes are discussed. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The role of social presence as defined by the community of inquiry (CoI) framework is critiqued through a review of recent literature. Evidence is presented that questions the actual extent of knowledge co-construction that occurs in most higher education settings and therefore challenges the framework's underlying assumption of the need for sustained, contiguous, two-way communication in higher-level online learning environments. The CoI framework has evolved from the description of a learning process within a social constructivist paradigm to an empirically testable construct in an objectivist paradigm. Related research results indicate that social presence does not impact cognitive presence in a meaningful way and that best teaching practices suggested by CoI-based studies are informed by objectivist, cognitively oriented learning theories. These suggest that higher-order cognition may be achieved through wide and varied combinations of learner-teacher, learner-content, and learner-learner interaction. Controlled studies can and should be undertaken to compare learning outcomes using sustained, contiguous, two-way communication to other learning models. To facilitate this, subcategories of social and teaching presences need to be revamped and analysis adjusted to separate processes that support explicitly group-based learning activities from those used by individual students.},

abstract={The design of a platform for blended learning is dependent on the educational and didactic theories. We discuss behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism and the impact of these theories on the elements of learning platforms. We describe the construction of a learning platform (of the Dept. of Information Science at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany), developed from the results of the didactic theories. The InfoCenter consists of elements of face-to-face teaching, of multimedia mediation (text books, slides, classic texts, interactive videos, FAQ lists, video glossaries), of Web 2.0 tools (wikis, weblogs, social networks, social bookmarking and folksonomies) and of the use of a learning management system (with learning units and tests). The platform was evaluated by its users (university students) by means of SERVQUAL. According to the evaluation, students are satisfied with the InfoCenter and are willing to use it for their exam preparation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={It is possible that the pedagogical benefits of a discussion board or any asynchronous communicative tool may not be realised as inscribed in terms like 'collaborative learning environment' or 'discussion board' due to two things: first, as instructors, we focus on what the technology can do and should do and ignore what is done when the technology is used in practice; and second, as researchers, we focus on coding messages into categories and mapping online activities into models that causes us, again, instead of seeing what is done, to try to fit our practices in situ into codes. As both instructors and researchers, we try to adhere to a constructivist view of teaching and learning. This article is about what is happening - the practice of blended/online learning and communication environment and tool (i.e. discussion board) as the technology-in-situ. It disentangles the word 'collaborative' from 'technology' and, in particular, the word 'discussion' from 'board'. Our very notions of discussion or collaboration and our understanding of the so-called collaborative learning environments define the ways in which we plan for an online activity. The author argues that constructivism has become a byword influencing pedagogy, its methodologies including designing so-called learning environments in ways that hide what is really happening when we are online. The case of the discussion board is described to illustrate that the board online can be other things too.},

abstract={Virtual learning is a popular teaching modality, and it has been reported in research that there is no significant difference in academic outcome as compared with face-to-face courses. Not all researchers agree with this assertion and some claim it is more difficult to teach math-oriented subjects online. Given that educational psychology theories are effective for teaching quantitative topics in the face-to-face modality, this study proposes and tests methods for virtual learning. Constructivism learning theory is applied using knowledge management principles to teach an online masters-level research methods course at an Australian university. Asynchronous and synchronous tools are used in the VLE, and contrasted in a controlled experiment. The hypothesis is student grades will be significantly higher when the constructivist instructional method is applied to the synchronous VLE. Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.},

abstract={New communication technologies and constructivist pedagogy have the great potential to build very powerful paradigm shifts that enhance Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) in distance education. Therefore, the main purpose of this chapter is to explore the new concerns, issues and potentials for the IPTV delivery of distance education to multicultural populations. In this study, the design strategies and principles of how to build social networking based on constructivist learning theory are discussed in order to generate a theoretical framework that provides everyday examples and experiences for IPTV in distance education. This framework also shows the needs, expectations and beliefs, and strengths-weaknesses of IPTV in distance. In short, this framework concentrates on discussing the main characteristics of IPTV in distance education and describes how those characteristics can help build constructivist online communities.},

abstract={Most previous studies on the use of Internet technology and computers for second language learning have been conducted in blended learning environments. Although much research has been undertaken into interactions in online learning, little work has focused on online English learning, let alone the pure-online (ie non-blended) English learning environment with no face-to-face element. This paper investigates the English-language learning interactions in one of our projects that has been running for ten years continuously in cooperation with the BBC and British Council. Our pure-online English-language learning environment for non-formal learning is at in2english.com.cn. This study further aims to explore how the interactions work in such an environment, and investigates the related issues and peculiar characteristics of the interactions in practice. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A combination of social network analysis and content analysis was used to investigate the interactions that took place in an online Moodle course among 22 participants that were enrolled in a teacher education graduate program. The purpose of this study was to examine both the patterns and quality of the online interactions, which were assessed using a content analysis schema. The social network measures of the online learning network demonstrated that Moodle may have the capability to help establish a cohesive online learning community where members are able to participate in meaningful social interactions. Results from the coding of discussion posts demonstrated that, despite active online interactions, participants still lacked higher level knowledge co-construction. Factors that might impede online knowledge construction processes are examined and discussed so that higher levels of knowledge construction can be encouraged and eventually realized.},

abstract={Learning is an active, social process. However, many distance education programs are flat and asynchronous with limited interaction. Virtual environments may be best equipped to foster an active social learning environment that provides optimal distance education. This study explored how nursing informatics students perceived the strengths and limitations of three different online modalities of learning: Learning Management System, Webinar, and Virtual Environments. Student perceptions of nine learning and instructional technology domains were explored using the Student Assessment of Learning Gains instrument (Seymour, Wiese, Hunter, & Daffinrud, 2000) with additional, open-ended question. Two concurrent themes arose from the three platforms: technical challenges and students showing preference for synchronous web-based learning. Virtual Environments emerged as the favored distance based education. As the availability and use of these technologies proliferates, educators are challenged to understand the effects of these technologies on student learning outcomes to optimize student learning.},

abstract={The extensive application of information technology and network technology enables learners to create their own "real-world" contexts to learn the target language with the help of the audio-visual materials available online. The whole process of learning is supposed to be constructed by learners. However, not all learners can fulfill the task in that they cannot ensure a satisfactory outcome of the learning process. This research aims at finding some effective evaluation methods. Learners are advised to take active part in the meaningful and communicative autonomous learning and teachers should cultivate learners' potentials to achieve ultimate target and effect of autonomous learning. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Learning is social and mediated, as argued by social constructivism. When learning groups gather very different people, this difference can be challenging. We had an Interpersonal Relationships course, a large class, around fifty students working collaboratively in groups where students from different degrees, academic years and ages, some of them deaf, tried, and to some extent were able, to communicate. We analyze this example of how diversity can be an asset and Moodle can act as a mediator. We were carrying out a participatory action research project within a blended learning environment supported by Moodle to develop collaborative and personal pedagogical strategies to improve the inclusion and engagement of higher education students in their own learning and evaluation. We have used content analysis of the online discussions held by the students, reflective descriptions of the classes, the students' e-portfolios, and interviews with the students. The paper describes, from this project, the challenges and potential of using Moodle in a learning context where deaf students interact with hearing students and illustrates how Moodle can facilitate inclusion and the participation of the students.},

abstract={This study aimed to explore the correlates among teachers' epistemological beliefs concerning Internet environments, their web search strategies and search outcomes. The sample of this study included 105 teachers from 63 grades 1 to 9 schools in Taiwan. The results show that the teachers with more advanced epistemological beliefs concerning Internet environments could utilize more sophisticated web search strategies (i.e. less irrelevant information-selecting) to filter and organize the information than those with less advanced beliefs. Also, the sophistication of epistemological beliefs was positively correlated to the search outcomes for open-ended questions. Hence, epistemological beliefs concerning Internet environments play an important role in web-based learning. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper examines the experiences of undergraduate university students in response to the employment of video podcasts to support learning and teaching about exotic ecosystems. Six, 15-20-minute podcasts were made accessible to students through a virtual learning environment, either online or to download to mobile technology. The students were free to watch the podcasts whenever and wherever they chose to. The perceived and actual effectiveness of the technology was assessed by written questionnaire, focus groups and summative assessment results. Students agreed that the podcasts were effective in supporting learning and teaching on the course, largely by offering a flexible and visual learning experience. The podcasts were also perceived as a useful resource for revision and assessment, providing visual images that stimulated factual recall and highlighted knowledge gaps. There were no significant differences, however, in examination essay grades comparing cohorts prior to and post adoption of podcasts. The key to improving the student learning experience appears to lie not in adopting new pedagogy, but in reflexively developing the existing pedagogic strategies employed by both teachers and learners. Of primary importance is uniting the individual learning experience of podcasts with group exploration and critical discussion in a collaborative learning framework. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={School surveys and reports on integration of ICT in teaching and learning indicate that the technology is mainly used in traditional learning environments. Furthermore, the most frequently used software in the classrooms are general tools like word processors, presentation tools and Internet browsers. Recent attention among youngsters on social software / web 2.0, contemporary pedagogical approaches like social constructivism and long time experiences with system dynamics and simulations, seem to have a hard time being accepted by teachers and curriculum designers. How can teachers be trained to understand and apply these possibilities optimally that are now available in the classroom and online, on broadband connections and with high capacity computers? Some views on practices with the above-mentioned alternative approaches to learning are presented in this paper, focusing particularly on the options for online work and learning programmes. Here we have first hand experience with adult and mature academics, but also some background with other target groups. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This study investigates inquiry-based interaction and learning outcomes mediated by two types of artifact-centered discourse environments. The study aims to promote social construction of knowledge by optimizing the division of mental effort between pragmatic and semantic grounding activities. We present a theoretical research model by combining social constructivism, grounding theory, and cognitive load theory. We carried out a quasi-experimental study using survey instruments, content analysis, sequential analysis, and knowledge tests for a holistic approach to understand the paradox of mental effort in online learning conversations. The primary finding of this study is that a linked artifact-centered discourse environment facilitates pragmatic grounding activities to attain a common ground in online learning conversations. Additionally, less need for pragmatic grounding activities leaves more room for semantic grounding activities. Finally, more semantic grounding activities lead to a deeper understanding of the learning material.},

abstract={A science curriculum should emphasize the nature of science, and foster the development of scientific habits of mind within the student population. This is particularly important within science content courses designed for practicing teachers, who will teach the subject matter as well as model scientific methods within their own classrooms. Previous science educational research revealed that inquiry-based and active learning strategies in traditional classrooms can result in meaningful student learning, but the translation of these methods in online environments is far less researched. Therefore, we focused on science curriculum development in the online environment by which science content, the nature of science, and scientific habits of mind can be conveyed to practicing teachers. Through numerous semesters (N = 10) and a variety of online science courses (N = 6), our research demonstrated that online science curriculum development proceeds successfully through incorporation of SCALE. The online science curriculum should focus upon Self-directed autonomous activities, Community-based learning, both within an online environment and within the teachers' local areas, Active-learning strategies that move practicing teachers beyond the confines of the computer environment, and Local Environment incorporation for easy access and relevance to individual online learners. The SCALE method allows for interdisciplinary and integrated science curriculum in a variety of online science environments. The resultant content is consistent with the theory of human constructivism, which stresses that ?less is more,? and it emphasizes meaning over memorization, quality over quantity, and understanding over awareness. SCALE can be accomplished through autonomous informal activities utilizing teachers' local field sites, history of science investigations, online community discussions, and interdisciplinary topic portals for self-directed research and classroom implementation. Our mixed methodology research investigations indicate that more successful learning occurs within an online science SCALE curriculum. SCALE may also result in more positive teacher attitudes toward online science courses. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Traditionally, the social aspect of project-based learning was mainly in the form of face-to-face communication and supplemented by online media such as email and discussion boards. With the emergence of Web 2.0, social networking sites, which are renowned for their strong social element, appear to be another useful tool to further support the social aspects of project-based learning. An exploratory case study approach was used to investigate how participants involved in two different project-based learning environments used social networking sites. Preliminary findings show that learners in "intense" project-based learning environments tend to use social networking sites for quick access to resources whilst learners in less intense environments use them for both asynchronous learning and communication. All participants found the social networking sites to be easy-to-use and useful for sharing information. Social networking sites were found to be useful and convenient, but not essential for project-based learning environments. © 2010 Christopher Cheong, Raghav Tandon, and France Cheong.},

abstract={The article summarizes the key technological changes that affected the accessibility, use of technology in higher education (HE) from the 1970s until the early years of the twenty-first century. It then discusses the range of effects that digital technologies can have on the HE curriculum, in terms of both the opportunities presented, and the demands made by changes in society and business. The main interest in the use of technology, however, is in the extent to which it can be used effectively for learning, and this issue is addressed in terms of its role in four different types of learning: through instruction, construction, discussion, and collaboration, which represent the key current themes in research on academic learning. Research on learning technologies makes reference to the classic theories of learning, and the embodiment of these in e-learning pedagogies is analyzed in relation to the learning technologies most appropriate to them. In addition to the role of technology to improve learning as an activity, the article also discusses its value for making the logistics of study more flexible, by taking learning support beyond the campus. Finally, the role of technology in the work of the teacher is discussed. Technologies that support the teacher explicitly in their role as designer and developer of their learners' experience of learning are still in their infancy. Moreover, the strategic context for innovation in learning technology lacks the focus it needs for truly effective use of technology in teaching and learning in HE. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Online education (E-Learning) in Latin America, by one side, has been developed widely in the last decade, and also is relevant how educative platforms have obtained significant advances adding innovating technical devices within educational environments such as second life, wimba, e-books, e-boards, etc., that have facilitated students wide access to processes of learning. But in the other side, this type of education has demonstrated some fragmentary advances in the field of didactics, cultural and social curricular adaptation to particular learning communities. Generally, e-learning in Mexico has been oriented by constructivism rhetoric as the main educational approach, while the philosophy and teleology of online education shows clearly a behaviorism background, which it might be more interested in the reproduction of practices instead of intercultural leaning possibilities. The curricular design for these courses, mainly, has done without the participation of scholars and students. This research focuses in the limits that online education has in building an intercultural students and teachers learning community at the universities in Mexico, in a period of 2006-2009. We use a qualitative and a phenomenological approach in order to analyze the different experiences the students and teachers have in facing the curricular and didactic designs of online education and the difficulties and opportunities of socialization while learning and producing knowledge. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Project-based learning provides students an authentic learning experience in which they are able to practice skills by constructing a sharable artifact. Internships are another approach in which stu-dents are given a real life work experience by being placed and working in an actual workplace. Thus, in this paper, we present an exploratory case study of a project-based learning internship in which seven undergraduate IT students were recruited to work on individual projects under the supervision of academic staff members. Additionally, a social networking site (SNS) was used by the interns and supervisors to determine its suitability for this particular environment. The SNS was used as it is conducive with project-based learning since they both have a strong social focus. It was found that the structure of the internship and the design of the projects were appropriate as positive results were obtained. Both supervisors and interns enjoyed the internship and the interns underwent a significant learning experience. The SNS was not found to be particularly useful for the environment in this study. This is primarily due to interns being close in terms of geographical proximity and time. It should be noted that the interns were working on independent projects and there was little value for them to communicate with each other in regard to their projects. © 2010 EDSIG (Education Special Interest Group of the AITP).},

abstract={The technological development achieved in each of the epochs of the human history has changed the means of production, communication, transportation and education. There are many results because of the incorporation of technology on education, including remote laboratories, online courses, and educational robotics. In recent years, the latter has become very popular because of its significant contributions to the learning process, strengthening of cognitive skills, including creativity, design and problem solving skills. However, this phenomenon has been focused in the developed countries, and many of the applications of the developing countries rely on a technological transference from the developed countries. This model is not the most suitable due to the fact that the tool should be adapted to the environment and its user, and not the opposite. This article presents some of the main contributions in this issue and outlines the TEAC2H-RI kit. This kit was developed based on the Colombian educational environment characteristics and the experience in robotics of the research group GIDIA. It will be used in Senior High School Students. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

This approach may be failing in an era when students seem to want more flexible learning and a constructivist approach to help them learn by doing as opposed to just listening. By utilizing the facilities offered by the internet, a blended approach to teaching is trying to improve results with online assessments, online seminars and recorded lectures offered in addition to the traditional approach. Whilst it is too early to report on the success or otherwise of this attempt, the early evidence is that students who care about their studies appreciate the flexibility it gives them and are responding well. © 2010 IADIS.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that contribute towards learning effectiveness in e-learning courses. A review of previous studies was carried out to determine those factors that are most applicable to a tertiary teaching environment and to propose a model to assess effectiveness in online courses. The virtual learning environment (VLE) was defined to establish the boundaries for measurement. Constructivism was explored as a teaching approach in tertiary online courses. This model provided the input for a demonstration of an online course measurement and feedback tool using Moodle. A current student group was used to demonstrate the tool's use and recommendations were made from the findings. Areas for improvement were discussed and recommendations made for future studies. Design/methodology/approach: In this study a literature analysis approach was followed to establish theoretical bases for the practical application of the theory. The objective of the study was to demonstrate a model to measure the effectiveness of an LMS in aiding learner success as the most important success indicator of an e-learning system. Findings: The demonstration of a survey tool in Moodle showed a possible method to determine preferences and measure the extent to which it was achieved in an online course. This study endeavoured to explore the factors that contribute towards improving learning effectiveness specifically in the e-learning environment. A model was proposed with the teacher, learner and design dimensions in the constructivist approach. Originality/value: This study sets out to answer the following questions: What is learning effectiveness and what factors influence learning effectiveness in e-learning? What factors are significant in measuring e-learning effectiveness at the Military Academy? And what general high-level framework can be used to develop a measurement instrument for future positivistic studies? © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={You don't need a hard drive anymore-at least that is what cloud computing proponents would have you believe-and there are real benefits and promising possibilities for using Webbased services and technologies to help monitor important topics, store research materials and ideas, organize and integrate everything from thoughts, to notes, to papers and citations. Add to this the ability to share materials and interact with others, and guided inquiry and integrated learning become feasible for the off-campus online researcher. In this workshop we will discuss the advantages, disadvantages, possibilities, and limitations of cloud computing as an integral part of the research process, and we will explore a variety of Web-based tools to meet the online researcher's needs. Participants will use iGoogle to build an integrated research platform, share bibliographies and notes through Zotero, customize RSS feed readers to monitor narrow academic topics, and sample some of the smart phone applications that can be easily repurposed for formal research. From My Yahoo to My EBSCOHost, Web sites and databases offer accounts and services to help streamline the search and research process for their users. For formal research, some tools stand out more than others, and there are ways to help users decide which will work best for them based on the nature of their topics and their learning styles. The session will include an introduction to Kuhlthau's theories of guided inquiry, the information search process, mediation, and constructivism. In addition, users will evaluate their own note-taking and personal organization strategies in general and as they are applied in research and paper writing. This workshop will be a more focused and updated version of those given for California Library Association and Internet Librarian in 2007 and the invited workshop given at Computers in Libraries in 2008.

abstract={The primary objectives of the "Learning English with Films" experimental blended course were the promotion of films as multi-functional language learning aids and the encouragement of collaborative online learning. Groups of 3-4 students highlighted, analysed, and explained the language content of a 5 minute film excerpt of their choice. The wiki tool in the Moodle open source learning management system (LMS) was utilised as both the group database management and project presentation tool. Despite initial difficulties in adapting to ICT based learning, a notable increase in classroom interaction and improvement in output organising skills were evident throughout the course as several peer teaching and language practice opportunities presented themselves in the form of language analysis, wiki planning, and problem solving. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper studies learning based on constructivism, PBL (problem based learning) and dialectic relations between subjects and objects, and gives explanations to the strategy of guidance on problem-based online class. By using comparative study, this paper discusses the strategies and contents of teacher's guidance in the context of online class, and practices the strategies and contents. The results demonstrate that if the strategies of guidance are appropriate, subject consciousness of students can be improved, as well as their participation in the class, so the class becomes more active. Meanwhile, the teacher for online class should be more competent in information knowledge, design and control of class than in traditional class. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses ways to foster cooperative learning through the integration of online communication technology. While the education experts believe constructivism produces a more positive learning experience, the educators are still facing problems in getting students to participate due to numerous reasons such as shy personality, language and cultural barriers. This paper will look into the factors that lead to lack of participations among students and how technology can be implemented to overcome these issues.},

abstract={This is an exploratory paper that uses the construct of connectivity to examine the nature of effective language teaching and learning in both face-to-face and online learning environments. Broader in scope than Siemens' notion of connectivism, the term connectivity accommodates both transmission approaches to teaching and learning and social constructivist views of teaching and learning that accord with Web 2.0's dialogue-building and social networking tools. The paper identifies five dimensions of connectivity, ranging from the connections that effective teachers make with their students in conventional classroom situations to the ways that effective teachers intuitively seek to meld their students into learning communities in blended and distance learning environments. The notion of connectivity also focuses attention on the complex and changing roles of teachers and their relationships with their classes in both traditional classrooms and more loosely-connected, virtual learning environments. The paper concludes by suggesting that, far from being redundant in a world increasingly shaped by socially-driven online interactions, classroom language teachers have a vital role to play in building and maintaining learning communities in which students are both supportive of, and feel supported by, both their teacher and their peers. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Self-testing is a means to check learning effect. Besides time-space restriction, there are many deficiencies in traditional offline self-testing. With the development of information technology, learners can have self-testing on the Internet. Self-testing on Internet, namely, web-based self-testing, overcomes time-space limitation of traditional offline self-testing, but there are still several disadvantages such as monotony and lack of interaction. In the article, a web-based self-testing system with some features of Web 2.0 is designed and implemented, aiming at overcoming the weaknesses of current online self-testing system. Firstly, taking English self-testing as an example, the framework of the system and functions of its main modules is designed according to theories of social learning and constructivism as well as the idea of Web 2.0 and the characteristics of server-side programming. Secondly, in accordance with the design above, a new system is implemented for English learners primarily by using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL comprehensively. The role and duty of webmaster are also described briefly. To test the system, some English learners were invited randomly to use it, and feedback information was collected from them after a period of time. It is shown by feedbacks that most learners are satisfied with the system, and the system is of distinct features and favorable practicality compared with other systems, but it still needs to be improved in the design of user interface and some other details. Results in the article demonstrate that the new system can overcome the shortcomings of current systems to some extent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Perioperative nursing is practiced in a technologically advanced, fast-paced environment, and there is a continuing shortage of qualified and competent perioperative nurses. The expansion of nursing education programs into web-based environments has the potential to address this shortage. Online learning is both effective and efficient and particularly appropriate for adult learners compared with traditional, lecture-style programs. This article proposes a conceptual framework that combines social constructivism, Benner's Novice to Expert theory, and the principles of adult learning to provide a basis for the design and implementation of future perioperative curricula. Although the proposed framework needs to be questioned and empirically tested through research, the application of this framework could potentially shift the quality of perioperative education to a higher level and result in safer, more highly reliable patient care. © 2010 AORN, Inc.},

abstract={The relational database management system course is integral part of software engineering training at Technology Learning Services. The learning goals and instruction methods need to be articulated in order to accomplish the training targets in the corporate training environment, given that stringent timelines. In this work, we compare three teaching methodologies with the selection based pedagogy proposed recently. The outcomes of the effectiveness are measured in terms of learning indicator and the course feedback from the participants. It is noticed that the selection based approach promotes several dimensions of learning such as learning by doing, learning by mistakes, peer reviews, reflections. The approach helps the facilitator create active environment to make learning as a fun activity. The differences between the methodologies with respect to time, collateral, mode of delivery are compared as a part of the study. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, new media is both augmenting and extending the traditional classroom with a variety of technology-based tools available to both students and faculty, and has created "new" virtual classrooms for anywhere, anytime availability to education. Despite the enormous potential for technology to support the educational enterprise in this emerging "creative" economy, technologies are still not yet fully integrated in the classroom and their association with educational outcomes is as-yet unclear. This book profiles scholarly work from around the world to examine closely the effectiveness of the newest media in education at bridging the gaps among and between teachers, students and subject matter at all levels, from K-12 through adult education. These pieces are theory-based investigations with implications for future research, theory and application. Contributors examine how the fields of education and new media have evolved and are continuing to evolve pedagogically and practically, from predominantly instructivist, with a passive, one-way teaching format; to constructivist, including teacher- and learner-controlled, sensorially immersive and socially interactive exchanges. This book will be of interest to students and faculty in the areas of new media in education, including distance learning, online learning and "virtual" learning. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

abstract={This research examines asynchronous participatory examinations, a new technology-mediated assessment strategy especially suitable for online courses. The participatory exam innovation utilizes information technology to support engaging students in the entire examination lifecycle, including creating and solving problems, and grading solutions. These learning processes enable students to not only gain new knowledge but also to strengthen their assessment skills. A five-semester field study in the U.S., supplemented by a small scale replication in Austria, investigated how participatory exams can facilitate higher-order learning and what explains students' acceptance of the innovation. An extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), adapted to the educational context, predicts acceptance based on three key constructs: "perceived enjoyment," "perceived learning," and "recommendation for use." The study results support the premises that participants perceive learning from all stages of the cooperative exam process, and that the innovation acceptance is a function of both intrinsic motivations (e.g., enjoyment of the experience) and extrinsic motivations (e.g., perception that one has learned from the process). © 2010 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper examines the effectiveness of three different online writing activities in formal university education: forums, blogs, and wikis. Constructivism - reflective and collaborative learning fostered by scaffolding - provides a main support for their use in education. Prior research regarding the use of blogs and wikis, especially in language education, is reviewed. The lack of detailed examination to determine learning outcomes, the absence of an evaluation mechanism, and the special difficulty language education holds for their appreciation are noted. The latter half of the paper presents exploratory research executed by the authors on the usage of forums, blogs, and wikis in an English as foreign language (EFL)-blended learning course in a university in Tokyo, Japan. A mixed-method approach was applied with survey, interview, and text analysis used for triangulation. The survey revealed students' positive perceptions of the blended course design with online writings - wikis being the most favorable, followed by blogs and forums. Qualitative text analysis of forum and wiki writings showed progress in their ability to differentiate English writing styles. The interview script analysis clarified the different merits students perceived from each activity. The variations provided by the blended course design served well in meeting challenges and were fun for them. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to determine the needs and problems of classroom teachers about designing constructivist learning environments and to lay down the practical suggestions concerning these problems. To this end, a total of 94 classroom teachers from 81 provinces who participated in the workshop aimed at designing constructivist learning environments within the framework of SBEP project were included in the scope of this study. The groups evaluated their own learning environments. Based on these evaluations, they formed documents which included defining their needs, the problems encountered and practical suggestions. It was concluded by means of document analyses that the learning environments were not real-life oriented, that they did not sufficiently relate to students' experiences, that the constructivist approach was not grasped efficiently and that students were not properly granted autonomy in learning process. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={This study aims to understand teachers' perspectives on their roles in higher education, their views about the adoption of a social-constructivist approach to teaching and learning and the integration of online collaborative learning in blended learning environments in higher education from a cross cultural perspective. We interviewed 60 Chinese teachers from Beijing Normal University and Capital Normal University in Beijing, China and 30 Flemish teachers from Ghent University in Flanders, Belgium. The results revealed differences as well as specific similarities in perspectives between the Chinese and Flemish university teachers. The cultural and educational context is taken into consideration when discussing the results. © 2010 Association for Teacher Education in Europe.},

abstract={It is substantially accepted that constructivism proposes knowledge as "not a fixed object"; constructed by an individual through her own experiences. As a learning theory, constructivism in education emphasizes collaborative learning, such as authentic challenging projects involving in students, teachers and experts in the learning community. Its goal is to create learning communities that are more closely related to the collaborative practice of the real world as strongly reflected in social constructivist idea. The technologies used in the filed of education will support learning through collaborative practices, using learners' experiences for "meaning making". The challenge now is to extend the educational networks so that it offers access to learning resources, online storage and tools for communication and management not just within the limitation of school and time. Through learning platforms, such as Moodle, teachers and administrators may bring hardware, software and supporting services together to enable more effective conditions among teachers and students. In this study, Moodle was used to support the 4th grade pre-service language teachers' (student teachers) one of the academic courses, named as "Field Experience". The student teachers were expected to prepare graduation theses in the field of English language teaching. Moodle was integrated as a technological learning aid and used as online support throughout a semester "course. So, we will discuss how Moodle was integrated as a learning platform, while discussing, the use of Moodle as a "course supporter" process, steps and the sample activities will be presented as well.},

abstract={A graduate course on cultural diversity, based in constructivist theory and structured on the Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services model, was developed and taught through classroom and online methods. The following research questions were explored: 1) Can an educational experience, built on constructivist learning theory tenets, change students' perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, and skills in the area of cultural competence? 2) Does the delivery method, online or traditional classroom, influence the degree of change? The study used a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest control group design using the Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among Healthcare Professionals Revised. Findings showed significant changes (p < 0.001) in cultural competence scores and subscores for all learners with both teaching modalities based on interval scale and in categories of cultural knowledge, skill, desire, and overall competence based on a nominal scale. The untaught construct of cultural desire showed the most significant improvement.},

abstract={This paper presents a research study that was conducted in the Faculty of Creative Multimedia, Multimedia University, Malaysia, to investigate students' perceptions in developing a multimedia project within a constructivist-based learning environment. Students worked in groups to create an interactive multimedia application using an authoring tool, and were solely responsible for every project development decision. They were then given a survey and asked for their comments and feedback to elicit their perceptions and attitudes towards this learning environment. A factorial analysis was performed on the survey and results showed that 5 factors influenced students' perceptions in developing a multimedia project within a constructivist learning environment. Multiple regression analysis further showed that motivation played a significant role in students' perception towards developing a multimedia project in this learning environment. These results were further supported by their survey comments and feedback. Results of the study showed that by setting an authentic task, via a multimedia project, into a constructivist learning environment, students became highly motivated learners and active in their learning process and provided strong support and encouragement for Malaysian educators to incorporate multimedia technology and constructivist learning into their classrooms. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={This case study explores the learning experiences of three international students who were enrolled in an online master's program offered by a large university in Canada. The aim of the study was to understand the international students' experiences with, and perspectives on, the online learning environment. Findings indicate that previous education and especially language proficiency strongly impacted the learning of these students in this environment. Non-native English speakers required considerably more time to process readings and postings and to make postings themselves. Their lack of familiarity with the details of North American culture and colloquial language made it difficult to follow much of the course discussions. They also tended to avoid socializing in the course, which left them at the periphery of course activities. Based on these findings, the authors make the following recommendations for designers and instructors of online courses: 1) Raise the English language proficiency requirement for graduate admissions into online programs because the text-based communication in a CMC space requires interpreting messages without non-verbal cues; 2) Ensure that online distance education course designers are aware of the needs and expectations of international students; and 3) Combine the design principles from both traditional and constructivism theories.},

abstract={Mobile collaborative learning is considered the next step of on-line collaborative learning by incorporating mobility as a key and breakthrough requirement. Indeed, the current wide spread of mobile devices and wireless technologies brings an enormous potential to e-learning, in terms of ubiquity, pervasiveness, personalization, flexibility, and so on. For this reason, Mobile Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning has recently grown from a minor research field to significant research projects covering a fairly variety of formal and specially informal learning settings, from schools and universities to workplaces, museums, cities and rural areas. Much of this research has shown how mobile technology can offer new opportunities for groups of learners to collaborate inside and beyond the traditional instructor-oriented educational paradigm. However, mobile technologies, when specifically applied to collaborative learning activities, are still in its infancy and many challenges arise. In addition, current research in this domain points to highly specialized study cases, uses, and experiences in specific educational settings and thus the issues addressed in the literature are found dispersed and disconnected from each other. To this end, this paper attempts to bridge relevant aspects of mobile technologies in support for collaborative learning and provides a tighter view by means of a multidimensional approach. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={This paper presents some ideas for the design of online activities for mathematics blended courses. The focus is on the integration of technology and research in the field of mathematics education, with special concern for language and semiotics. In the section 'Background' we give: • an overview of the outcomes of research that underline the complexity of educational processes, and in particular the need for taking into account not just cognitive, but also meta-cognitive and non-cognitive aspects; • a framework for dealing with language and representations in order to effectively interpret students' behaviors. In the section 'The potential of e-learning' we show how some of the activities provided by a standard e-learning platform can help to implement some of the ideas presented in the 'Background' section. In the section 'Teaching and learning opportunities' we show examples of teaching activities which fulfil some of the requirements sketched in the previous sections and apply some of the ideas and methods discussed there. The section "Future trends and conclusions" includes some discussion of the opportunities for future research. In all the examples described in this paper we mainly refer to Moodle (see Moodle documentation).},

abstract={This paper documents the experience of designing, developing and implementing a VLE, using the Moodle VLE platform, at a South Wales comprehensive school. As part of a joint initiative facilitated by the University of Cardiff and the University of Glamorgan called 'Beacon Researchers in Schools' a comprehensive cross-functional team was set up that included teachers, an ICT technician, A VLE technician and a project manager with appropriate expertise in pedagogy. Once the basic framework of the VLE was established, it was then tested via a research exercise that involved the science teacher and the pupils with an aim to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the technology. In this experiment, a wiki section was constructed within the VLE. A class of KS3 top level, year 8 pupils (N = 25) were required to log onto the Internet and undertake the necessary research to help address questions set by the teacher. Assuming a problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogical approach along with a constructivist epistemology, the pupils were then asked to post their research findings onto the wiki. This exercise helped to develop research and analytical skills as pupils sought to find necessary online material and determined what information they deemed as authentic and relevant to the task. The pupils were then required to edit the postings of their peers. Overall, a successful outcome has been achieved and at a very low cost in an environment of tight budgetary constraints. The pedagogical design of the VLE was therefore vindicated and serves as a platform for further development thereby providing significant future benefit to the school and its pupils. This study will be of interest to researchers, teachers, VLE developers and pedagogical experts. It is believed that this experience will enhance the ever-growing pool of knowledge in terms of VLE design and its pedagogical underpinnings.},

abstract={Change and development in work settings for better working practice through projects has become essential. And, in this context, learning through working practice is constructed by participatory action research. This work-based research has a significant role to contribute innovative practice of Distance Education Institute at Eastern Mediterranean University by EUA norms. The research aimed to investigate implementing constructivist approach into online course designs to develop learning and skills of the online students based on teamwork inspiration within the institute. Action research approach employed in this qualitative research in order to provide insights on how to prepare and design online courses based on constructivist approach. Training, in-depth interviews, documentary analysis, focus group, research diary and semi-structured interviews were employed as data collection techniques to gather large amount of data from online tutors, and members of institute in relation to their collaborative efforts within the process. Furthermore, triangulated data were analyzed based on content analysis in this inductive journey. The results revealed that members and the tutors had no prior knowledge and experience on team work culture and the principles of constructivist approach into online course designs. In this respect, collaborative efforts and synergy power of the tutors within participatory action research resulted in better working performance for change and development research actions. This research is significant for considering change and development in working practice in relation to implementing constructivist approach into online course designs as it is one of the critical success factor for the quality in online practices.

abstract={As educators utilize an increasingly wide range of technologies for facilitating interaction between distant learning parties, there are concerns over the ad hoc use of technology in online course design and activities that are not grounded in sound pedagogical frameworks. This chapter presents a case of a hybrid undergraduate course that is shaped by sociocultural constructivist principles. Survey findings on student experiences of online collaborative learning and group work processes in two constructivist-based learning activities are reported. Results reflecting sociocultural constructivist concepts of scaffolding and appropriation of shared knowledge are presented based on student learning experiences during online synchronous tutorials and collaborative team projects. The conclusion discusses the effectiveness of the two course activities in facilitating collaborative group learning and recommendations are offered to enhance overall student experiences of online collaborative-constructivist group learning processes. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={Renowned Soviet psychologist and father of social constructivist learning theory Lev Vygotsky (1978) stated: "Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level" (p. 57). In online practice, social constructivism involves students learning from and with each other in computer-mediated collaborative learning communities. In order for students and faculty to succeed in the online social constructivist environment these efforts demand institutional support. This chapter will introduce issues facing students and faculty that relate to the implementation of online social constructivism. Recommendations focusing on online student support and professional development will be offered as well as a discussion of future trends pointing toward a digital divide between the students of institutions who do support these practices and students of institutions in which faculty have to make do. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to analyse the context of learning for a group of health professionals currently studying for an online Masters programme in Professional Practice, Health and Social Care. The theories that dominate the design of much online learning is set within Vygotsky's theory of social constructivism. It was felt by the programme team that it was important therefore to understand the world of the student in order to situate teaching and learning appropriately. Lave and Wenger's theory of 'communities of practice, provided a framework for a series of interviews with current students on the programme. The analysis of the data provided an indepth insight into the learning contexts of the students and promoted reflection amongst the programme team. © 2009 IADIS.},

abstract={This paper discusses the use of wiki technology in higher education. Wikis are simple online information systems which often serve user communities. In higher education, wikis have been used in a supporting function to traditional courses; however, there is little research on wikis taking on a larger role as learning environments. This paper explores how wikis support goals of constructivist learning environments, especially communal constructivism theory. Further, it summarizes results of current research using wikis in the classroom and considers elements which can improve the use of wikis for learning. The paper concludes with a proposal of nine guidelines to improve the use of wiki technology as learning environments in higher education. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

The findings show that students performed satisfactorily, and appear to have gained from exposure to the new perspectives on governance. At the same time, the findings also point to the need for building strategies into course delivery to facilitate learner development of the higher order learning skills required not only for the study of the course but for continuing professional practice.

abstract={Constructivism has become the comfortable face of educational theory in recent years, due in no small part to the mainstreaming of learning technologies since the 1990s. Many of these technologies embed constructivism in their aspirations and actual design. But, generally speaking, the uncritical acceptance of constructivism as beneficial to education has been widespread - not surprising, perhaps, given that teaching as a profession has tended to be inspired by practice rather than being theory-led. In this chapter, the authors attempt to explore the uncomfortable tranche between theory and practice which constructivism currently occupies. Education has historically been about hierarchy and the control of knowledge and knowledge-flows, rather than about the construction of knowledge by the "amateur" individual or group. Constructivism conspires to foster active learning and the organic creation of knowledge, a radical departure from the accepted authority of the curriculum, leaning towards learning situated in the context of the learner, which is ultimately non-objective in the traditional manner. Is a bridge between theory and practice possible? In considering this question the chapter draws on the authors' experiences in designing and running an on-line graduate degree program according to constructivist principles. In doing so, it also attempts to describe and evaluate the impact which constructivism as a theory could have on the reality of teaching and learning practice in the early 21st Century. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={The quasi-experimental study reported in this paper examined whether students were more satisfied and learned more using an online discussion with peers or a hardcopy reflection with one-time feedback from the facilitator/instructor. A t-test was used to measure the difference between an experimental section and a comparison section of the same course on: post-course ratings of how well the course objectives had been achieved, what students hoped to gain from the course, satisfaction with the course, and student end-of-the-semester grades. Students in the group who participated in the weekly online discussions with peers indicated higher rates of accomplishing what they hoped to gain from the course than those who turned in weekly hardcopy reflections with one-time feedback from the facilitator/instructor. Students expressed a preference for the method of reflection used in their course section. However, the students' ages emerged as an important variable in their preference for online discussion. There was significant difference between the groups on ratings of how well the course objectives had been achieved, but not in satisfaction with the course, or course grades. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Online discussions are popular in virtual classrooms since they provide students with opportunities for more effective interactions than possible in traditional classrooms. However, grading online discussions is well-known to be a time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a method for automating the partial grading of online discussions using social network analysis techniques. In particular, we propose to use a centrality index, which reflects the number of responses to a student's messages as a proxy measure to evaluate the quality of students' posts and hence determine participation levels in discussions. The method was tested for grading discussion board assignments in a virtual class from an online graduate school. Although, the method was found to perform quite well in a range of situations, its use is advocated mainly as a grading aid because in certain conditions inaccurate grades may result. Furthermore, use of the tool can also be envisaged for improving performance levels in online discussions because of its potential as facilitation and motivational aids. © 2009 Cheong & Corbitt.},

abstract={Online discussions are popular in virtual classrooms since they provide students with opportunities for more effective interactions than possible in traditional classrooms. However, grading online discussions is well-known to be a time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a method for automating the partial grading of online discussions using social network analysis techniques. In particular, we propose to use a centrality index, which reflects the number of responses to a student's messages as a proxy measure to evaluate the quality of students' posts and hence determine participation levels in discussions. The method was tested for grading discussion board assignments in a virtual class from an online graduate school. Although, the method was found to perform quite well in a range of situations, its use is advocated mainly as a grading aid because in certain conditions inaccurate grades may result. Furthermore, use of the tool can also be envisaged for improving performance levels in online discussions because of its potential as facilitation and motivational aids. © 2009 Cheong & Corbitt.},

abstract={Innovative learning activities, based on constructivism, were applied in the courses for students of Computer science at the Faculty of Education. We observed students' learning behaviour as well as their actions, preferences, and learning patterns in different stages of learning process, supported by the e-learning environment. Students engaged in all these activities had an opportunity to develop competences for team work and collaborative learning. Active and collaborative forms of learning were used to facilitate higher order thinking skills and to develop assessment skills. We used Bloom's Digital Taxonomy to analyse the usage of digital tools which facilitate different phases of learning. Active and collaborative forms of learning, such as mini-performances supported by workshop, autonomous learning supported by video-content with interactive questions and answers, collaborative editing of wikis with peer assessment, pair programming, explorative learning, discovery learning, reflections, self-reflections, and creation of exercises for knowledge assessment are used to facilitate higher order thinking skills.},

abstract={Contemporary educators have been reassessing pedagogical frameworks and reevaluating accepted epistemologies and ontologies of learning. The age-old debate whether knowledge is gained or constructed seems drawn to a consensus in the 21st Century: those who seek knowledge are active participants in the learning process and they have uniquely 21st Century attributes. Web 2.0+ technologies, various social media (Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, YouTube) and online virtual reality environments (Second Life, World of Warcraft, Sims) have influenced today's students in ways that constructivists should explore, embrace and exploit. This essay explores how Second Life (SL) effectively employs and distills the principles of educational constructivism. SL offers endless opportunities for immersion within user-constructed environments and activities. Educational use of SL may facilitate learner-led activities and yield learning that is prompted by desire and curiosity rather than learning for learning's sake. By exploiting these qualities with constructivist pedagogies, educators create environments that challenge and enable students to engage in the deepest kinds of learning. © 2009, IGI Global.},

Digital diaries (Gleaves, Walker & Grey, 2007) were established to enable a reflexive and collaborative space in which students could discuss and reflect on their personal experiences while completing a compulsory arts industry Internship. The virtual learning environment (VLE) through my eLearning Vista allowed for a range of asynchronous communication initially in the discussion forum (DF) for these online learners to increase student engagement while completing their internship. The DF did allow students to collaborate and discuss their work practices in the arts industry it however, did not offer students the reflective learning space that a digital blog diary could provide. It will be argued that blogs are effective teaching and learning tool for engaging students proactively in a collaborative learning space in higher education. © 2009 Arianne Jennifer Rourke and Kathryn Coleman.},

abstract={This paper explores the learning design process a practitioner underwent when tasked with re-designing the curriculum for a fully online programme of study for a campus-based UK university. The process entailed constructive alignment, which is implemented by using the stated learning outcomes as a mechanism to check that the expected learning is likely to take place. The use of learning and teaching taxonomies and the mapping of pedagogy with appropriate technologies aims at avoiding a pitfall of producing e-learning design that mirrors existing practice. Using this approach it has also been possible to identify learning outcomes that have not been addressed within the current online provision. This has allowed the creation of robust pedagogically sound innovative generic activity sequences to be created at the appropriate meta-cognitive level. Furthermore these sequences tap into a variety of learning theories including, social constructivism and situated learning. The paper proposes that such an approach yields numerous advantages to institutions and practitioners (and ultimately the learners) that are tasked with curriculum re-design including re-use of design models and processes, resource planning and the identification of roles in complex professional subjects. These advantages will be discussed as will the issues relating to their implementation. © Common Ground, David Morris.},

abstract={Based on constructivism theory, the paper stated the construction and application of network teaching system, three-layer Browser/Server mode (B/S) was used in developing teaching system. This operating mode could place all kinds of teaching resources on the server side, and uses unified database storage and organization. Users on the client side browsered the webpage through server agent which was linked with background database and responded to teaching request. With the language of HTML as the development tool, ASP+IIS technologies as tools for front development and the ACCESS database services as a background database support, the paper laid em1phasis on discussing the realization of collaborative learning environment and construction of testing system. Compared with conventional teaching, the students who take networking teaching enhanced learning initiative (students who initiative learn increase 20%), and well trained their collaborative spirit, practical and creative ability. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This chapter examines the rationale for the use of computer games in learning, teaching, and assessment in Higher Education. It considers their pedagogic potential in respect to a number of theories of learning, as well as some of the practical issues associated with using computer games in real teaching situations, both face-to-face and online. The first part of the chapter focuses on the theory underpinning the use of computer game-based learning with HE students, examining motivation and engagement, constructivism, collaborative and problem-based learning. The second part of this chapter considers the practical issues of using computer games in actual teaching contexts and presents twelve principles for the design and evaluation of computer games to support learning. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={Social Constructivism and Cognitive Load Theory constitute the two major poles in thought about online education. Social Constructivism stresses engagement, while Cognitive Load Theory stresses understanding. The article believes there will always be a tension and trade-off between these two imperatives. The heterogeneity of learning materials promoted in social constructivism might have disorienting effects on students through the cognitive load they impose. But over-cautious introduction of authentic problems into instruction might lead to disengagement and boredom. The author concludes by recommendations for learning characterized by structured and contextualized engagement as a way to manage the trade-off between the two imperatives.},

abstract={This chapter focuses on discussing the use of social software from a social constructivist perspective. In particular, the chapter explains how social constructivist pedagogies such as collaborative learning and communities of practice may be supported by the adoption of social software tools. It begins by briefly discussing the social constructivist perspective considering certain pedagogies such as collaborative learning and communities of practice. Then, it explains how these pedagogies are reflected in actual practice by using a variety of social software tools such as discussion boards, blogs and wikis. Finally, the chapter presents the implications of using social software based on the impact of certain factors such as teachers' understandings of, and beliefs about, teaching in general. The purpose of this chapter is to support higher education practitioners in theory-informed design by distilling and outlining those aspects of social constructivism that addresses the use of social software tools. It is perceived that a gradual introduction of social software to institutional Virtual Learning Environments, with a strong focus on collaborative learning processes and engagement in online learning communities, will highlight the need for discursive tools, adaptability, interactivity and reflection. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={Taking into account the complexity and multiplicity of constructivist theories, the first part of this chapter focuses on the relationship between epistemology and pedagogy in constructivism, in particular in the radical constructivist position of von Glasersfeld, which is considered a significant referent in constructivism. To overcome some of the shortcomings of radical constructivism, the author have then explored the origins of constructivist theory and practice in the work of John Dewey, whose ideas could be still a source of inspiration for constructivist educational practice. The second part of this chapter analyses the social constructivist development in different internet-based learning platforms and social software and considers at the end some practical difficulties and benefits of online learning for the implementation of constructivist learning theories for learners as teachers. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={In 1985, the North American Group of the Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education affirmed the notion that the constructivist perspective would provide guidelines for instructors to facilitate student learning. The constructivist view of the student as an active learner as well as the present day emphases on the automation of the calculations and the student learning of the concepts has motivated the use of multimedia in the online teaching of statistics. Here, I examined the influence of the constructivist perspective on the teaching of statistics, the influence of the constructivist perspective on the use of computer assisted calculations and on the use of automated simulations and the significance of teaching with data. Based on this examination, one may improve upon the teaching of statistics (1) by accounting for the omission of elements of sound and video that were observed for past online courses, (2) by providing instruction on how data is produced for an empirical study, (3) by providing small data sets to show the influence upon the statistic of outliers, skew and variance heterogeneity through the use of manual calculations, (4) by providing large real datasets so that students may draw substantive conclusions about the statistics, and (5) by using automated simulations to convey the statistical properties of the sampling distribution of the statistic. © 2009 IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={In this chapter, the case of a blended university course will be described in detail. The main focus of this description will be on how some constructivist principles - such as knowledge building, active and self-directed learners, collaborative learning, communities of learners and practice - can be applied to compose the architecture of a blended university course. The course carefully integrates online activities with face to face meetings. Several educational models are also combined to guide the design of individual, small-group and collective activities able to exploit issues such as digital identities, E-Tutor, online role-play, and E-Portfolio. Principles of constructivism were always followed when setting activities and meetings. The description provided is mainly useful for teachers and educators interested in implementing a blended course with clear references to constructivist pedagogy. In addition, theoretically founded roles, tasks, and activities are outlined. The thoughtful mix of pedagogical models, online and face to face activities, individual-dyads-small group and collective learning contexts is the strongest point of this course. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={This chapter looks at the ways in which teacher training and teacher development are taking place online. It seeks to address the ways in which teachers learn to teach and considers how "Web 2.0" applications and other collaborative, interactive technologies may transform teacher education. In an overview of teacher development theories, including social constructivism and critical reflection, the chapter attempts to situate current practices in relation to research in teacher learning. The second part of the chapter focuses on blended and distance learning, Computer Mediated Communication, and the applicability of Web 2.0 applications to teacher development. It is hoped that the chapter will provide a useful summary for teacher trainers and classroom practitioners who are hoping to use technology for developmental purposes.

abstract={This study investigated the change in Singaporean pre-service teachers' epistemological beliefs and beliefs about learning and teaching over the course of a teacher preparation program. An online survey was administered during the first week of a nine-month program and the same survey was administered after the 413 participants had completed all their course work and teaching practice. Participants exhibited significant changes in epistemological beliefs and beliefs about learning and teaching - participants indicated more relativistic epistemological outlooks and less constructivism in beliefs about teaching. At the end of the teacher preparation program, they seemed to less value effort in learning and believed more in innate ability. © 2009 Australian Teacher Education Association.},

abstract={This paper introduces the reader on how to foster successful learning communities to meet the diverse needs of university students by creating a brain based online learning environment. Students come in all shapes and sizes. At the university level, students enrolled in online programs, have made a choice to do so. Today, online education is a unique and important venue for many students wishing to continue (or start) their education. It is part of a new culture with many distinct characteristics (Farrell, 2001). For instructors, online instruction creates its own set of challenges in terms of the course design and implementation. The author hopes that developing an understanding of how to create a brain based online learning environment will inform the reader of ways to foster successful learning communities to most effectively meet the diverse needs of the students it serves.

abstract={This study implemented an online peer assessment learning module to help 36 college students with the major of pre-school education to develop science activities for future instruction. Each student was asked to submit a science activity project for pre-school children, and then experienced three rounds of peer assessment. The effects of the online peer assessment module on student learning were examined, and the role of Scientific Epistemological Views (SEVs) in the learning process was carefully investigated. This study found that student peers displayed valid scoring that was consistent with an expert's marks. Through the online peer assessment, the students could enhance the design of science activities for future instruction; for instance, the science activities became more creative, science-embedded, feasible and more suitable for the developmental stage of pre-school children. More importantly, students with more sophisticated (constructivist-oriented) SEVs tended to progress significantly more for designing science activities with more fun, higher creativity and greater relevancy to scientific knowledge, implying that learners with constructivist-oriented SEVs might benefit more from the online peer assessment learning process. These students also tended to offer more feedback to their peers, and much of the peer feedback provided by these students was categorized as guiding or helping peers to carefully appraise and plan their science activity projects. This study finally suggested that an appropriate understanding regarding the constructivist epistemology may be a prerequisite for utilizing peer assessment learning activities in science education. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Objective. To assess the online social constructivist learning environment (SCLE) and student perceptions of the outcomes of the online introductory module of pharmacy professional practice that was designed based on social constructivism theory. Design. The online introductory module of pharmacy professional practice in pharmaceutical marketing and business was carefully designed by organizing various activities, which were intended to encourage social interaction among students. The Constructivist Online Learning Environment Survey (COLLES) was applied to assess the SCLE. Course evaluation questionnaires were administered to assess student perceptions of this online module. Assessment. The result from the COLLES illustrated the development of SCLE in the course. The students reported positive perceptions of the course. Conclusion. An online introductory module of pharmacy professional practice in pharmaceutical marketing and business was effective in promoting SCLE.},

abstract={Learning through social interactions and critical thinking is becoming a fundamental teaching approach, especially for adult students. This approach promotes holistic and deeper understanding for the subject being learned. Online technologies are offering us new opportunities to create communities of inquiry that allow for more active learning that enhances students' critical thinking. This article introduces an exploratory case in a Middle Eastern context that uses multiple online activities to supplement and strengthen the students' face-to-face learning environment. This interpretive case discusses the students' perceptions of their experience when using online activities. The case indicates that students improved their learning, are very positive about their first interaction with online activities and would like to see it as a standard practice to supplement their face-to-face learning. © 2009 IGI Global.},

abstract={Sociocultural constructivism regards communication as vital to the collaborative learning process. In virtual learning groups, dialogic online interactions are the means for exchanging information, social and emotional support that facilitate knowledge construction. A number of studies have analyzed the quality of such electronic educational discourse with discourse and content analytical methods for indications of collaborative knowledge building. However, this paper reports the use of social network analysis (SNA) in tandem with perception survey analysis to analyze and interpret the e-communication patterns of two virtual learning groups. Social network analysis (SNA) is defined as a set of methods enabling the disciplined inquiry into relational patterns between actors based on the assumption that interactions are building blocks that define and sustain learning groups. The data examined in this study comprised electronic logs from weekly online synchronous (chat tutorial) discussions and responses to a web survey from the undergraduate participants of the two tutorial groups. The SNA measure of reciprocity was used to analyze mutuality in information exchange present in the dialogic interaction during the chat tutorial discussions. The reciprocity value shows the strength of the tendency of the group towards mutual exchange of information. Additionally, a web survey was administered to the student participants that covered the extent of peer learning support perceived to be available during the learning process. The quantitative SNA results revealed different tendencies towards reciprocation of ties at group level. The quantitative survey results showed a stronger perception by one group on the availability of peer learning support that was consistent with the SNA findings. These findings on the e-communication patterns in collaborative learning networks are particularly relevant to researchers for the greater insight into the functioning of effective virtual learning groups. The recommendations presented in this paper can also help e-tutors to design facilitation strategies and manage online collaborative learning processes.},

abstract={This study broadens the objectives of previous work (Boyer, N., Langevin, S., Gaspar, A. (2008). Self direction and constructivism in programming education. Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group in IT Education Conference, 16–18 October 2008, Cincinnati, OH) in which we used a survey-based instrument, the Personal Responsibility Orientation Self-Directed Learning Scale–PRO-SDLS (Stockdale, S.L., & Brockett, R.G. (2006). The continuing development of the PRO-SDLS: An instrument to measure self-direction in learning based on the personal responsibility orientation model. Paper presented at the 20th International Self-Directed Learning Symposium, Cocoa Beach, FL), as a new perspective to measure the impact of innovative approaches in the teaching of computer programming in online courses. The data have been collected during the offering of an undergraduate online asynchronous programming course delivered in 2008 at the University of South Florida Polytechnic. Our primary pedagogical intervention has been the use of peer learning forums which attempt to (1) leverage peer learning dynamics in an online course, (2) help students better structure their work on a weekly basis, and (3) help them learn to engage actively with the material (e.g., exercises, reading assignments). This article studies the impact of peer learning forums on these students through the lens of various instruments. Some, such as the PRO-SDLS, are well established in the self-directed learning literature. Others are introduced in this article to provide a more complete picture of both the students' self-perception of their self-direction and its more observable aspects. We also identified intrinsic characteristics of our student population, which we believe to have a significant impact on these instruments' measures. Finally, we relate these data to student feedback obtained through more open question surveys. These observations, made using diversified instruments, on a small and well-characterized learner population, represent the foundation of our case study. Our findings suggest that, after using the peer learning forums for an entire semester, the self-perception of our over-committed online adult learners' ability for self-directed learning has evolved to realign itself with more observable manifestations of their self-direction. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Social constructivism and computer-assisted learning has received a great deal of attention in the pedagogical and technological research literature. However, there is almost no knowledge about the effect of social networks (c.q. interaction between students) in computational assignments and the educator's role as a provider of exemplary cases. Most studies have exclusively employed survey data to investigate social aspects of educational computing which can be shown to be highly misleading - if not biased. Some studies have tried to explore social networking based on objective measurements of forum data (c.q. discussion threads in learning environments) - the fundamental problem with these studies however, is the lack of content-related meta information (there is no information about the content of the discussion unless all posts are coded by the researcher). In contrast to existing literature, this paper presents an illustrated exploration of an educational database which contains objective measurements of meaningful, social behavior in statistical computing based on several statistics courses with large student populations. All communications between students are uniquely identified by their statistical and educational context which implies that crucial types of objective meta information about the meaning of those messages is available. The main emphasis is on the following educational aspects: collaboration between students, competition between groups of students, and the usefulness of worked-out examples that are provided by the educator. The aim of this paper is to show that the newly developed Reproducible Computing technology provides us with new ways to research social networking/interaction in assignment-based and constructivist learning. In addition, it is shown that a series of new research questions arise from the explorative data analysis of the measurements that were collected. Copyright The Authors, 2009. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Whether we are lovers of constructivism or connectivism, or at heart just plain old rewarders of good behaviour, as university teachers we often aim to develop collaborative communication amongst and within learning groups as part of what we see as sense-making and learning. The benefits of communication mediated by good teachers is widely discussed in the literature, especially in relation to technology enhanced or online learning (Laurillard 1993; Mason 1994; Su et al. 2005; Kim 2008). But of course such collaborative communication has been practised for generations in the classroom by those who consider one-way lecturing an outdated and constraining practice. George Siemens' perspective of connectivism moves us towards a concept of knowledge residing in networks which will not be wholly internalised or known by individuals, but which relies on the development of appropriate connections and the ability to evaluate worth within an abundance of knowledge (Siemens 2004). Technology plays a large role here, whether we are talking about "learning in education", "learning in work" or "lifelong learning". So what role can technology-enabled communication play in helping learners learn? This paper seeks to review the currently favoured methods of communicating between teachers and students in the specific context of Higher Education, in order to determine which methods may be useful in which contexts of learning. As teachers, we have to decide where to expend energy and time to best result amongst the different communication options now available. Five principal communication channels are analysed: email groups used outside a Learning Content Management System (LCMS), discussion forums used within LCMS, synchronous conferencing (or livechat) within LCMS, wikis within LCMS based on ELGG software, and group blogs within LCMS based on ELGG software. While these five channels represent different stages of communications technology (CT) and do not include webconferencing, it is proposed that a brief reflective analysis of these increasingly commonly available CTs will allow us to explore their value in learning and opportunities for collaboration. Affordances of these CTs are found to include variations of structural fit to expected communication outcomes, and power and identity of communicators, as well as defined purpose, are seen to produce different results depending on the chosen channel of communication.},

abstract={This paper is a case study of the multimedia/converged media newsroom at Abilene Christian University. The multimedia newsroom designer created a space in which students are able to apply to student media products the theories and praxes they are discussing in the traditional classroom. Just as many professional news organizations move toward more converged environments, media educators must provide opportunities for students to learn in such environments. Through an exploration of constructivist learning theory and professional industry standards, the designer of the multimedia newsroom at Abilene Christian University gained an understanding of cognitive development and how it relates to learning, as well as professional practices and expectations for graduates. The multimedia newsroom comprises the print, broadcast and online student media products. Each of the products is a part of the whole -- each providing its unique advantages to the coverage of a story. Students produce media in an environment that cultivates collaboration between faculty and students and among peers in a technologically advanced facility. The goal of the multimedia newsroom is to provide student learning opportunities in a progressive media environment that is functional, attractive and supports the curriculum. In addition to fostering understanding and respect among the staffs of different students media outlets, the newsroom has created a synergistic learning environment by providing opportunities for students to observe and participate in each other's processes since it opened in January 2008. © Common Ground, Susan Lewis, All Rights Reserved, Permissions.},

abstract={This paper examines how a learning management system (LMS), coupled with sound pedagogical approaches, is used to develop learning communities for students undertaking a problem-based learning university course. Students use the LMS to undertake team-based work, including meetings, communications, and submission of assessments. Data collected on students' usage of the LMS communication technology, and quotes from students' reflective portfolios, demonstrate that effective learning 'communities' are being created in virtual space. Despite never meeting in person, off-campus students formed functional teams and reported developing a great sense of 'community', which fostered mentoring and collaborative learning. The LMS supported the development of an online learning environment that encouraged reflective thought and dialogue with others, both of which are critical to transformative learning and social constructivism. The learner was compelled to become an active participant in the learning process, which allowed students to appreciate the value of participation, trust, mutual respect, and diversity. © 2008 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={Online learning's exponential growth during the past decade has pressed the development of new strategies and methods for online course design. The call to develop course materials that appeal and captivate the interest of online learners is louder than ever. This article focuses on the results of a doctoral dissertation that targeted instructional designers and administrators of online learning programs regarding their perceptions and practices pertaining to the design of constructivist learning environments in online course design. The combination of instructional design and constructivist theory is known as constructivist instructional design. What are the perceptions of instructional designers regarding constructivist theory for online course design? What is the importance of designing online courses based on constructivist theory? How can the theory of constructivist learning assist instructional designers and faculty as they design or redesign online courses? Results include the rationale and frequency for its adoption, barriers and type and number of activities grounded in constructivism. © 2008 IADIS.},

abstract={Perkins, a professor of Education at Harvard University, promoted the use of constructivism in conjunction with information processing technologies to facilitate students' understanding and active use of knowledge and skills. He identified five facets of a learning environment including: information banks, symbol pads, construction kits, phenomenaria, and task managers. This paper proposes a plan for information literacy instruction that adopts Perkins's (1992) five facets of learning environment through a technology foundation that includes some constructivist learning approaches. Foremost the plan enhances the librarian's visibility in the student's course work through faculty-librarian collaboration utilizing problem-based learning as well as the promotion of the embedded librarian in community colleges. An additional feature of this proposal includes an interactive tutorial that incorporates gaming software to increase student engagement in the learning environment. Lastly, options for face-to-face bibliographic instruction in a library's electronic classroom are also components of the plan. Ultimately the plan utilizes technologies, novel and traditional learning theories, and innovative instructional approaches to engage students in information literacy instruction.},

abstract={The mobile Game-Based Learning project (mGBL, www.mg-bl.com) is a 3-year European Commision funded project that began in October 2005 under Information Society Technologies (IST) programme Partner organizations forming the project consortium are drawn from Austria, Croatia, Italy, Slovenia and the UK. The project is coordinated by Evolaris Privatstiftung, a research laboratory based in Graz, Austria. Some learners do not like using games or they are not very competent in playing certain types of game (de Freitas, 2006), so the consortium is developing different types of game design that signpost to other learning materials and thereby facilitate integration of mGBL games within a blended learning environment. The project partners are committed to designing real games that are fun to use and user friendly, engaging target audiences: students and young adults aged 16 - 24, a priority age range for the EC. Game focus is on the decision-making in crisis situations - EC priority area of concern. Support for life-long learning is another EC priority; therefore the goal is to design games that are standards-based, to suit a 'blended learning' approach (i.e. a mix of formal and informal learning). A central goal of the project is to research the usability and usefulness for purpose of the mGBL prototype game templates and examples in order to optimize the usage experience, not only of the students themselves, but also of the teachers as developers (using the platform) of the learning games. In-depth analysis of user experience, both in the usability lab as well as in the field, will deliver valuable insights into requirements for the system design. Three game types have been designed and template development and content development is underway. The first game template was developed with E-commerce content (called "Ahead of the game"). The second game was developed with two types of content: E-Health (called "Mogabal" - acronym of MObile GAme BAsed Learning) and E-guidance (career guidance). The third game (called Digital economy) was developed with E-commerce content. mGBL research takes place within a social constructivist (Vygotsky, 1982) theoretical framework that emphasizes intrinsic learning through social interactions such as modeling or imitation and accepts the plurality of meanings. Social constructivism is highly relevant to the mGBL development that will be informed by WP6 research: the target audiences will exhibit different learning intelligences and preferences and will expect mGBL learning models to be intrinsically motivating. Moreover social constructivism holds that socio-affective factors and the role of mediation of action through artifacts are significant in encouraging learning. Again, this is highly relevant to the mGBL project, which recognizes socio-affective factors in decision-making and puts tools in the hands of learners. In order to test the system, content on e-health and e-commerce was developed for the user trials and tested in the transnational environment (end-user evaluation, expert evaluations and laboratory usability tests). It was also essential to open up to new groups of learners up-to-date narrow education schemes. For this reason, specific focus in the evaluation process was given to ensure that mGBL will be capable of supporting these new education concepts and therefore wider target groups in general. The mGBL project focuses on a wide target group which on the one hand is diversified by involving young people from different societal fields, from different regions and countries. The major end user target groups of the project are younger people in general and for the specific test cases younger people who are: preparing decisions on their school or vocational career or students, especially in the field of e-health or e-commerce. For the first target group, mGBL will assist new ways in career advice through personalized professional orientation:It is important to employ target-group oriented media, in particular interactive web and mobile services to support the decision-making processes. The approach to support these processes by collaborative and interactive as well as individual game based learning applications is attractive for this target group. This new web and mobile supported advice should go far beyond the search for and passing on of information; instead it must go into the emotional issues behind a career choice. For the second target group, students, the project aims at building a platform to also support sustainable learning through inspiring edutainment. By not only preparing content in a way that it can cognitively be taken in, but also in an emotional way, the mGBL project strives for new, effective means of learning. Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains remains the most widely used system of its kind in education particularly and also in industry and corporate training. Reason for that is because Taxonomy of learning domains represents such a simple, clear and effective model, both for explanation and application of learning objectives, teaching and training methods, and measurement of learning outcomes. There are 3 cycles of User Trials that relate directly to the iterative process adopted for mGBL design and development. The first User Trials were undertaken in September 2006, at end of year 1 of the project. The resulting findings informed the Construction phase of the mGBL prototypes. The second User trials took place in September 2007, finishing at end of year 2, with findings informing the final cycle of development that begins in September 2007. The final cycle of User Trials takes place in January -February 2008 and will inform the transition phase of the project. Overall results from the first User Trials showed that there is no significant divide in the usage of mobile technologies and learning habits between tested students from different European countries. Although the respondents were somehow sceptic about using mobile phones in the learning process, after trialling the games most of the students were convinced that the potential in using mobile phones for educational purposes really exists. Overall results from the second User Trials showed that all focus groups are favourable to the project, even the biased student group in Slovenia (no one used to play games). Teachers thought that the game with multiple possible scenarios and open-end game would give them an insight on how the students think, how they make decisions, how they could apply that thinking into ≫real life≪ situations. That way the game would tackle the collaborating part and team work in education and real life. Perhaps the most sophisticated research has been done using mGBL games during whole course teaching. Measurements taken after the completion of the experiment show that the attitude towards the pervasive game is clearly better than the attitude towards the case study. This indicates a high degree of acceptance and fun while playing, and substantiates previous experiences from pervasive learning games. It has also been proven that students generally respond more positively to learning games than they do to other learning methods. There is still plethora of challenges that mobile game based learning should address, from ethical and legal to technological and financial issues and maybe most important and most difficult challenge to encourage officials to take up the mobile games for learning support in higher education environment. © 2008 IADIS.},

The 'Cawskills Project' delivered online IT training directly to employees. The findings from the project have informed the development of a generic but adaptive model for SMES to facilitate the need for training by considering the operational demands, resources constraints and infrastructure. This paper presents a model, which brings together principles of teaching and learning practices evident in classroom based education along with the learning requirements of SMES and employees. The incorporation of online learning aims to deliver training content, which is Just in Time (JIT) and proposes training events informed by SME'S strategic direction.},

abstract={The role of the mentor is critical in facilitating effective learning for nursing students whilst on practice placement. Placement learning accounts for 50% of a three year programme undertaken by student nurses. Clinical practice presents a constantly evolving environment within which new research and policy necessitate continuous updating of knowledge and skills. It is the mentors' responsibility to teach and summatively assess the clinical nursing skills of the students whilst on placement. Effective continuing professional development (CPD) is essential in enabling mentors to undertake this role effectively. Mentors are currently required to attend annual events to update knowledge and skills. These update events have traditionally been delivered in the class room environment, but attendance has become increasingly problematic for busy health care professionals. This project aims to utilise the Internet to provide an alternative to the traditional face-to-face update event and to facilitate the development of a forum for ongoing peer support. The initiative will be piloted amongst mentors from a local NHS Trust and evaluated using a combination of online focus groups and electronic programme feedback questionnaires. It is anticipated that this pilot will contribute to the development of a model of online CPD for clinical mentors. © 2008 IADIS.},

abstract={The aim of the innovation education subject in design education is to train students to identify needs and problems in their environment and to develop solutions: a process of ideation. This activity originally classroom based is now facilitated through the use of a Virtual Reality Learning Environment technology (VRLE). Such technology supports online communications between students and teacher and enables them to develop drawings and descriptions of their solutions. The VRLE is network based and the students work online in the school with their ideas in real time. This paper describes the basic innovation education (IE) pedagogical model and the subsequent development of the VRLE. These are discussed in relation to constructivist learning theories.},

To this end, we used the lens of the Personal Responsibility Orientation [2] to measure the impact on student self-efficacy and self direction of our interventions. These learning activities were introduced based on peer learning and authentic student feedback principles. They consisted of peer learning weekly forums and student-led "live coding" hands-on exercises. These were applied to both an introductory (cop2510 [14]) and intermediate (cop3515 [5]) programming courses. Results derived from an online anonymous survey are presented and interpreted. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Today's smartphones are mini multimedia computers, they are generally equipped with: 3G and WiFi internet connectivity, a 2 to 5 megapixel camera, Bluetooth for device interconnectivity, USB2 for computer connectivity and media synchronisation. They have digital media storage capacities of 1 to 16 GB, will play back most standard audio, image, and video formats, are GPS enabled, are integrated into online media and social networking sites (Flickr, YouTube, blogs, MySpace, Facebook etc...), and are capable of recording (and some can even edit and display on large screen video devices) video between QVGA and VGA quality. These smartphones are promoted by their manufacturers as lifestyle tools to enable sharing experiences and social networking via web2.0 sites, and mobile friendly media portals (e.g. Ovi, iTunes Store). The ubiquitous connection to web2.0 tools and collaborative communication and user generated content creation capabilities of these devices make them ideal tools for facilitating social constructivist learning environments across multiple learning contexts. However, designing good pedagogical environments to integrate the successful use of these tools is essential. This paper reports on the progress of several qualitative action research trials being conducted to investigate the impact of smartphones and mobile web2.0 on teaching and learning in higher education. These trials illustrate a variety of pedagogical designs and the creation and support of mobile learning environments. © 2008 Thomas Cochrane.},

abstract={This paper explores the development and implementation of a structured computer-based learning tool, named a "SkillQuest", for undergraduate students studying introductory project management at Bond University. This SkillQuest, "Making sense of all the dollars" was developed as an alternative to a lecture on project budgeting. Students are placed in a real-life working environment via a project scenario relevant to their chosen degree. In alignment with the theories of Gestalt, Constructivism and Experiential Learning, the SkillQuest provides a collaborative, student-centred approach where the lecturer acts a facilitator to the learning process. Student survey responses indicate the SkillQuest was a useful learning tool, interesting and a pleasant change from lectures. Statistical analyses of exam results support the use of the SkillQuest as a teaching tool. Use of the SkillQuest to actively engage students in the learning process was deemed a success. It is the belief of the authors that this type of computer-based, collaborative learning can allow students to learn more interactively and in an environment that more closely aligns with their learning preferences. Such a tool can be used in any university discipline in place of the traditional lecture-style approach or as a complement. SkillQuests can be undertaken with the instructor present in a classroom setting or as homework, making them also useful for online studies. This was a small pilot study in a single application. The authors hope that others will adapt this tool for use in their classrooms. © 2008 Marian Williams, Shilo Brosnan and Jenna Swan.},

abstract={Virtual environments are providing students with realistic experiences that go beyond the computer simulations of the past. This paper, and subsequent presentation, will allow the reader to see a virtual world through the eyes of an avatar, an avatar whose real life is focused on inquirybased learning and constructivist techniques, and whose human persona had serious concerns about multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs). Those educators who have doubted the educational value of virtual worlds such as Second Life and other MUVEs, are beginning to understand the usefulness and pedagogical possibilities of classes, libraries, and resources in digital environments, including the NMC (New Media Consortium) and other university based locations. Underlying these adventures is a focused perspective on experiential learning and constructivist theory. How do young students gain knowledge in a highly visual and graphic environment? How do the interaction and social networking aspects promote or contain learning opportunities? What kinds of questions and challenges best motivate and engage students? Research on gaming, experiential learning, and situated learning in authentic contexts, supports the importance of using a select group of thoughtfully planned virtual activities in safe, well chaperoned electronic environments.},

abstract={In the emerging digital landscape of the Web 2.0 era, where social software tools like blogs, wikis and podcasts provide instant connectivity, promises of engagement and community building, there is a need to rethink models for teaching and learning. In this paper, the authors argue that outmoded didactic models, which place emphasis on the delivery of information by an instructor and/or from a textbook, may need to be replaced in order for student-centred learning to come to fruition. Currently, e-learning pedagogies at universities and colleges appear to be fuelled largely by learning management systems (LMS's) that replicate these traditional paradigms in an online setting. They conform to a "student-asinformation consumer" model, thereby reinforcing instructor-centred approaches to teaching, learning and knowledge, as opposed to being conducive to constructivist modes of learning that enable a high degree of learner self-direction and personalisation. This paper also explores a range of examples demonstrating productive pedagogical applications of social software tools. A number of recent constructivist theoretical paradigms are presented that have the potential to transform teaching, learning and pedagogy in higher education. © 2008 Catherine McLoughlin & Mark J.

abstract={Web 2.0 tools are collaborative Internet applications that allow for facilitation of communications between individuals and organizations. Examples of Web 2.0 tools include blogs, wikis, Second Life, and social networking. This manuscript reviews classroom implementation of Web 2.0 tools at three Northeastern US universities. The importance of Web 2.0 instruction is examined via literature review and pre and post class testing of the students involved in the courses. It was found that knowledge of Web 2.0 skills is generally regarded as being very important. Students who took the course and were educated on Web 2.0 skills increased both their knowledge and comfort level after the course. A detailed analysis of student perceptions both prior to taking the course and after instruction are reviewed. © 2008 EDSIG.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the usability and interface design of e-learning portal developed for primary schools in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach Using Singapore-based learning EDvantage (LEAD) portal as a case study, this paper reviews and analyses the usability and usefulness of embedded learning objects (LOs) for students aged nine years and above through learning theories such as behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism and interface design theories by Shneiderman, LO review instrument and laws of gestalt psychology. Findings Analysis found the portal to be sufficiently motivating and appealing to learners at Piaget's concrete operations stage. The interface design is universally structured and functional. An area for improvement highlighted in this case study is the lack of explicit mention of learning outcomes in the portal. Practical implications Usability principles used in this case study should be provided by the Ministry of Education in Singapore to schools to ensure more standardized and rigorous selection process of e-learning portals. Originality/value This evaluation provides schools with insights into the use of learning theories and usability principles for evaluation of learning objects designed for primary-going students. It aims to inform decision makers of issues in interactive design to consider before subscribing to any e-learning portals. It also provides a gauge of current usability level of commercially developed portals as usage of such portals continue to proliferate in the Singapore education system. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={This article focuses on the development of a collaboration within the Glasgow Caledonian University, essentially as part of a wider Community of Practice, to develop a range of audio and video resources within an online virtual community. It also outlines how the integration of audio and video has enhanced the learning experience for students. Although the original project was aimed specifically at social work students, the revamped site has been constructed to meet the needs of students from a diverse range of other disciplines. Clydetown is a fictitious town that is populated by a number of virtual families, each with their own social and health issues that bring them into contact with a range of services and service providers. Students are able to utilise the materials to help construct their own understandings of the issues and to discuss and debate with others. The pedagogical influences are explored and are essentially constructivist in orientation with the use of audio and video being examined as adding an 'authentic voice' to the subject matter. Students are encouraged to test the theories and understandings offered to them within more traditional forms (lectures, journals, etc.) against the authentic lived experiences of those who are directly involved.},

abstract={This paper describes how to introduce the mechanism of knowledge innovation into online learning community (OLC) and constructs a model which can facilitate innovative knowledge and develop online learner's ability of knowledge innovation. The model is represented by three levels, namely: individual, collaborative and intermediary level, which is based on theories of knowledge creation and management, cognitive and social constructivism. Individual knowledge innovation begins with internalization, via combination, externalization and socialization, which is different from Nonaka's SECI. In collaborative knowledge innovation, learners in OLC share, compare, negotiate, create and integrate knowledge together. Individual knowledge innovation and collaborative knowledge innovation need certain intermediary. In doing so, individual knowledge applied to OLC situation can produce, promote and create new knowledge of OLC. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In web-based education, virtual learning communities are formed to support interaction and attain explicit educational outcomes, with Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) technologies facilitating most of the interaction. From the sociocultural constructivist view that knowledge building occurs during dialogic interaction, little is known about the impact of online synchronous (chat) interaction on supporting knowledge construction, while online asynchronous interaction has been more widely researched. Moreover, analytical frameworks for educational Computer-Mediated Discourse (CMD), mainly designed for asynchronous discussions, are typically less sensitive to chat exchanges. This paper examines the impact of chat interaction on supporting the knowledge construction processes in two tutorial groups. The discourse analysis results revealed participant involvement in meaning negotiation that builds new knowledge. The survey results showed the availability of scaffolding and the appropriation of shared understandings that are characteristic of knowledge construction processes. These findings can guide the pedagogical design of online synchronous instructional environments that facilitate learning through the conversations of virtual learning communities. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.},

abstract={With the rapid advances in technology, several online learning tools come onto the stage. Being an online learning delivery tool to support a full range of teaching and learning activities conducted by educational institutions Moodle facilitates online content creation and collaboration by entailing various social and communication tools that support teacher-student, student-student, and teacher-teacher interactions. This paper presents the "Moodling" (Moodle, 2005) experience within a secondary school in a developing country, namely Turkey. Based on a focus discussion group with the foreign language teachers, the author depicts the critical points that need to be taken into consideration so that an effective collaborative online platform for both teachers and students to learn together can exist.},

abstract={A constructivist approach in teaching and learning requires one to change various habitual ways for thinking (von Glasersfeld 1995). There is a need for different ways of thinking and doing things, if conventional education is to realise a constructivist worldview. Educators and trainers in both academic and work sectors are promoting the use of the Internet for flexible and learner-centred learning. The intention of this paper is to examine the popular online learning pedagogy and question if the emerging formal higher education practices advocate a constructivist view of knowledge. The discussion begins with an introduction to the constructivist view. Although participation in online discourse is popularly recognised as social constructivism, the problematisation and critique of online practices help to challenge the formal education interpretation of constructivism. References to the emerging research and established literature on learning are used to identify the normalising influences of academic courses that require compulsory participation in online discussions. The choice to learn in silence is discussed in reference to the power differences influencing online discussion participation. The emerging online pedagogy is challenged for its limited appreciation of diverse learning preferences that is a central aspect of constructivism. The conclusion of the paper draws from data analysis in the author's doctorate study, which is in progress. It proposes how online and offline educators who aim for learner-centred and constructivist learning could use the insights gained from this analysis.},

abstract={Two disparate research programs have addressed the challenge of instructional multimedia design. One, based on cognitive load theory, has focused on ways of reducing unnecessary cognitive load during instruction to free up resources for learning. The other, based on constructivism, has centered on interactive multimedia, allowing students to build their own knowledge. Attempting to build on both bodies of literature, in this study, we investigated techniques that can raise the useful cognitive load engendered with linear multimedia. Participating online from home, students were pre- and posttested around a short multimedia intervention that explained Newton's first and second laws. In Experiment 1, students who watched a video dialogue involving alternative conceptions reported investing greater mental effort and achieved higher posttest scores than students who received a standard lecture-style presentation. In Experiment 2, two additional multimedia treatments were evaluated to assess the role of instructional time and the method of addressing alternative conceptions. In all, 272 students participated in the experiments. Interviews suggest that students adopted a more active approach to understanding the material if alternative conceptions were raised. In addition, students who watched the dialogue judged themselves to be similar to the student in the multimedia. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Being an online learning delivery tool to support a full range of teaching and learning activities conducted by educational institutions Moodle facilitates online content creation and collaboration by entailing various social and communication tools that support teacher-student, student-student, and teacher-teacher interactions. This paper presents the "Moodling"(Moodle, 2005) experience within a secondary school in a developing country, namely Turkey. Based on a focus discussion group with the foreign language teachers, the author depicts the critical points that need to be taken into consideration so that an effective collaborative online platform for both teachers and students to learn together can exist.},

abstract={The social constructivist approach to translator training represents a clear statement on the importance of directing university teachers towards a student-centered, learning centered mode. By acknowledging the fundamental role of Vygotsky in determining his approach, Kiraly brought translator training in fine with the established, broad-based humanistic approach to Foreign Language Learning; by drawing on Stevick and Schön, among others, he made this debt explicit. In this article, we apply the social constructivist approach through blended e-learning environments in courses offered to final year undergraduate students of translation. Our objective is to determine the success of combining technology and social constructivist pedagogy in promoting effective learner-centered learning. In Kiraly's terms, we have "scaffolded" our instruction by applying instruments such as rating scales of criterion-referenced descriptors; textual and visual aids; and learner generated corpora. Our qualitative data is drawn from a variety of interactive formats: whole group online discussions, team-based online discussions, e-mail exchanges and specific "reflective" activities. We conclude that the quality of the "scaffolding" is essential to success in stimulating learning and that the e-learning environment is an excellent medium for the social constructivist approach.},

abstract={The education of health care professionals cannot be limited solely to the study of health care systems within one's own region or country. Active participation in the global community requires nurses to develop an expansive view of health care. In addition, nurses need to develop communication skills enabling them to interact globally in the pursuit of better health for populations. Experience is required with technologies to enhance global communication in relation to health. Theoretical Framework: Social constructivism. Design: Evaluation study using a descriptive survey and content analysis of an online student discussion group. Sample: 21 pre-registration undergraduate nursing students from one university in the United Kingdom and 13 nursing students (10 pre-licensure and 3 graduate students) from one university in the United States. Method of Data Collection: Students were divided into small groups and participated on two discussion boards via WebCT. The objective of the discussion boards was to facilitate exchange on issues related to health concerns and behaviors common to the respective geographical regions. A self-completion on-line questionnaire was developed to evaluate the educational benefit of the discussion groups in facilitating knowledge exchange. Method of Analysis: Descriptive statistics for survey items and content analysis of the narrative comments on the survey and the discussion board. Findings: While some variation between the students from the different countries was identified. Students generally found the experience beneficial and gained a greater insight into different health care systems. Discussion board narratives indicate some common health concerns among students on both sides of the Atlantic. Student comments on the evaluation survey indicate a preference for a real-time format. Application to Nursing Education/Practice: International discussion boards are a cost-effective and pedagogically sound strategy for facilitating student learning regarding global health issues. They also increase student familiarity and competence with online tools relevant to the healthcare setting.

abstract={This empirical study focused on whether the use of Weblogs positively changes the learners' attitudes towards EFL writing. A quasi-experimental research design was applied with a mixed-melhods approach to elicit data from 119 EFL students in two universities in Taiwan. The collected data included 112 pre- and 102 post- GEPT exam papers, 119 questionnaire responses and the qualitative data of interviews with 24 research participants. These data were then analysed using inductive (qualitative logic) and deductive (quantitative logic) methods to find out the consequences of the research assumptions. The results corroborate the theoretical findings on the significance of computer-mediated communication in learners' affective learning. In other words, the use of Weblogs influenced the learners' attitudes towards EFL writing. The combination of quantitative and qualitative findings suggested that Weblog technology engages learners in active reading and encourages learners' reflectivity, collaboration, and participation in EFL writing. Finally, the results also echo the theoretical concerns about the learners' self-efficacy and language register in the context of second language writing.},

abstract={In higher education, the use of constructivist approaches in online learning reflects agreement with educators who stress that good teaching is both a collaborative and a highly individual process. Online constructivist application also suggests congruence with adult learning theory and educational programming designed for experiential and inquiry-based learning. The objective of this chapter is to investigate perceptions of teaching and learning in online instruction guided by the Vygotskian perspective of constructivist theory. The chapter first focuses on current research studies of online constructivist-based course development and application and then proceeds to the authors' practical inquiry project, which examined (1) instructor perspectives on creating and facilitating online learning communities and (2) students' perceptions of their online constructivist experiences. The authors conclude with a discussion of their findings, contributions to the field and suggestions and challenges for the principled use of a constructivist approach to online teaching. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.},

abstract={Online environments are regarded as well constructed to support collaborative and social learning. This research investigates small group collaboration and learning in the context of online exams. Incorporating constructivism and collaborative learning theories, the online Collaborative Exam features students' active participation in various phases of the exam process through small group activities. The online Participatory Exam features similar processes except that students participate in the exam individually. A large scale field experiment was conducted to compare the two exam structures in terms of learning strategies and exam outcomes. Results show that students in the collaborative exam adopted significantly higher levels of social engagement than those in the participatory exam, learned from other students, and formed a sense of learning community. Areas for future research are briefly discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Using current and emerging technologies, such as podcasts, blogs, conferencing tools, and virtual worlds, can expand student and faculty interaction, improving both the content and the effectiveness of both online and traditional class formats. An overview of educational philosophers indicates that these forward thinking technologies can promote the best of the tested theories in ways that were never before possible. Podcasts can provide reinforcement and clarification of the learning experience. Blogs can be vehicles for documenting factual material as well as expressing creative and original thinking. Real time conferencing tools can support meetings, collaborative projects, mentoring, and tutoring. Virtual worlds show promise in education particularly among traditional age students who have grown up in an electronic culture. Research has shown that communication tools, used thoughtfully in a constructivist teaching setting, can contribute to effective learning, higher student satisfaction rates and increased retention. Examples and suggestions are based on ten years of efforts by Lesley University faculty to find the most educationally sound, administratively efficient, and financially viable way to offer outstanding online learning experiences.},

abstract={Online course templates based on specific learning designs were developed to support course enhancement at the University of New South Wales. Course designs are based on constructivist theory and activity theory with an emphasis on promoting active learning. Collaborative learning and problem-based learning models were used to design templates based on successful online and blended courses. A simplified template with a learning activity focus was used in staff training programs and as a basis for school templates. Templates were developed in Blackboard Vista, but could be applied in other learning management systems. This paper outlines development, implementation and evaluation of the templates and discusses the barriers and potentialities in dissemination of learning design templates. © 2007 Iain McAlpine and Belinda Allen.},

abstract={Since 2000, the Open Polytechnic University has been working at e-learning methods as a commitment to introduction of Communication Technologies into training process. The development of grade and postgraduate subjects was a specific way of putting it into practice. The figures support our work; 200 courses have been developed at the moment and more than 10,000 students are using our e-learning platform. The future looks brilliant for e-learning when the development course process is a quality procedure and the contents are designed for online training purposes. Teachers must consider the online training materials differently from other training materials as there are distinct and specific pedagogical aspects to bear in mind; this is the reason why they follow the pedagogical modules structure designed by the Open Polytechnic University. On the other hand, teachers from the Polytechnic University of Valencia can take advice from the Open Polytechnic University in order to apply new technologies to their courses. The Open Polytechnic University offers training to teachers in e-learning and give them resources to improve their skills in order to teach their subjects by means of an e-learning platform. The courses development process at the Open Polytechnic University is a process called "stages and experts," because several expert agents are involved. They work together in a multidisciplinary model that gives quality to the courses - a quality that is proven by the Open Polytechnic University stamp. All this process is based on our own author tool, e-learning platform, and pedagogical methodology. Copyright © 2007 Idea Group Inc.},

abstract={This paper reports the findings of a small-scale study that investigated student nurses' use of an online resource in Biology. The think-aloud method was used to explore in detail the ways in which students engaged with this resource and to evaluate the ways and extent to which it might enhance their learning. The students generally expressed positive views about the resource, which they used in a variety of ways to supplement more traditional learning activities. They placed particular emphasis on the benefits of using the resource to reinforce lecture materials and to aid revision for exams. Less frequent, however, were references to deepened understanding of the subject matter, raising questions about the type of learning that students were engaged in. The possibility is discussed that 'surface' rather than 'deep' learning may be encouraged by this type of resource, and the potential tension is highlighted between the rhetoric of constructivism, which is prevalent in e-learning, and the information transmission model of learning, which is highly influential and often favoured by students. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Sustaining participant engagement within collaborative online learning environments has proved problematic in a range of educational settings. It is not surprising then, that much of the literature around collaborative online learning has pointed to a pressing need to stimulate levels of participation and engagement. The underlying assumption seemingly being that increased participation will, in and of itself, lead to better learning outcomes within online environments. This paper argues that being overly concerned about participation and enjoyment levels may result in approaches that, at best, promote shallow forms of constructivism, rather than affording opportunity for deep knowledge building. The study reported in this paper draws on a body of research that has shown that levels of participation are inconsequential to the quality of knowledge building that occurs. Thus, when working with online groups there is a greater need to scaffold for the quality of interaction and output rather than the quantity of interaction. © 2007 Alan G. Roberts.},

abstract={This paper tries to explore the nature of the web-based knowledge acquisition and sharing process in the context of social constructivism environment, particularly when the learners and teacher are distributed over physical distances. A meaningful model is proposed for the development of an effective interactive and collaborative knowledge sharing and management workflow in web-based learning systems, particularly in scenarios where teachers and learners are geographically dispered. The proposed model is developed by integrating social constructivism pedagogical principles, as well as the latest computer network communication technologies. Data have been collected from previous studies to test the variables in the model. Some data collected are taken from classroom-based learning environment, however, they may be also applicable to other scenarios in general. In the present paper, only some pairs of variables have been tested using a meta-analytical approach. Although more data need to be collected and further investigations need to be done in the future, the results from the preliminary tests have shown fairly strong indications of co-relation between the tested variables, which complies with the variables suggested in the model and therefore provides the ground for the proposed model.},

abstract={In spite of their apparent benefits, learning management systems can be regarded as a hindrance to effective online learning. Their design, functionality, complexity, price, and value are beginning to be questioned by some users. As a new generation of Web-based tools and approaches evolves, Web-based learning management systems are becoming better suited to meet the need for dynamic online learning, interaction, collaboration, and networking. The new tools and collaborative approaches these systems provide allow learners to take proactive control of their own learning. In June 2004 a consortium of New Zealand Tertiary Institutions led by the Waikato Institute of Technology secured a one-year Ministry of Education grant to support the "Open Source Courseware Initiative New Zealand" (OSCINZ). The OSCINZ project focused on the development and implementation of "Moodle" (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) to create a uniquely New Zealand learning management system, based on quality open source code developed and tested by leading educational providers. This paper describes the response of faculty in three of the project's partner tertiary institutions to the implementation of Moodle in their institutions. © 2007 The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={The paper explores how computer mediated communication can be used to effectively promote critical thinking skills among online learners in higher education. Critical thinking is a process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing and constructing information to become one's own knowledge. The effective use of a new technology needs to be related to how learners learn. This paper attempts to examine the learning theory underlying computer mediated communication and discusses cognitivism, collaborative learning, constructivism and situated learning. The latest technologies in computer mediated communication are investigated further by identifying the potential as learning tools. The definition of internalization may throw light on the key question of this study. Finally, we conceptualize the idea that computer mediated communication could promote critical thinking among learners through internalization within a community of learners.},

abstract={Language differences and diverse cultural norms influence the transmission and receipt of information. The online environment provides yet another potential source of miscommunication. Although distance learning has the potential to reach students in cultural groups that have been disenfranchised from traditional higher education settings in the past, intercultural miscommunication is also much more likely to occur through it. There is limited research examining intercultural miscommunication within distance education environments. This article presents the results of a qualitative study that explored the communication experiences of Canadian faculty and Aboriginal students while participating in an online baccalaureate nursing degree program that used various delivery modalities. The microlevel data analysis revealed participants' beliefs and interactions that fostered intercultural miscommunication as well as their recommendations for ensuring respectful and ethically supportive discourses in online courses. The unique and collective influences of intercultural miscommunication on the experiences of faculty and students within the courses are also identified. Instances of ethnocentrism and othering are illustrated, noting the effects that occurred from holding dualistic perspectives of us and them. Lastly, strategies for preventing intercultural miscommunication in online courses are described. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Organisations that provide education are businesses and, as such, are not immune from the impact that the Internet has had in recent years, both on the way organisations conduct their business and as a business supporting technology. Indeed, the use of the Internet as a facilitating mechanism for educational course delivery has been growing steadily over the last 5-8 years and, although there are some significant issues that have arisen in that time in relation to the quality of learning that can be achieved, there is no doubt that it will continue to be developed as an educational tool. The real issue for educators is, therefore, not whether the Internet will be used in course delivery, or if it is a useful tool, but rather how can a teacher make best use of it to enhance learning? This article documents a study that has analysed five years of student reflections on the scaffolding mechanisms used to promote and encourage learning in five Internet-based courses at the University of Queensland run between 2001 and 2005. The courses involved include three Internet-delivered Masters coursework courses and two Internet-delivered undergraduate courses in three different discipline areas. The outcomes of the study are: (1) a Report Card documenting student evaluations of the scaffolding mechanisms used; (2) a What, Why, How, Where framework of scaffolding mechanisms that are best suited to enabling deep learning through the online environment, and (3) a proposed new model of knowledge acquisition in online learning environments entitled ESCIE, which is based on Nonaka's SECI and Ba models of knowledge creation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={SIGCSE-CSRM's mission is to support collaborative exploration of content, pedagogy, and curricular issues related to teaching research methods in computing (CRM). The committee runs a listserv and a wiki, including a repository of CRM course materials. At ITiCSE 2006, a SIGCSE-CSRM working group developed a sense-making framework for teaching computing research methods, a list of core skills for research in computing, and a list of specific CRM skills. Having accomplished its initial goals, SIGCSE-CSRM has begun discussion of our next steps. Three areas of interest have been identified: (1) disseminating the framework and getting feedback from people adopting the framework; (2) annotating, organizing and expanding the results from our literature search into an online annotated bibliography; and (3) exploring the relationship between CRM as a whole and CRM in specific communities of practice such as SIGGRAPH. During the session, committee members will present the history of SIGCSE-CSRM as a design process, provide an overview of the sense-making framework developed by the WG, and then lead a group discussion concerning each of the proposed next steps, as well as any suggestions from the floor.},

abstract={This article presents a description of the design of a learning environment focussed on topical scientific issues in an online and distance education setting. The subject area, genetic modification (GM), is a controversial and complex subject, of interest to a wide target audience. The focus of the learning design is to provide learners with a broad understanding of the underlying science involved, using this as a basis for informed debate on the risks and benefits of its use. The learning design model used is based on a model initially developed for multimedia design (Kommers, 2001) which incorporates a four stage process where the first two stages, conceptual and metaphorical, are emphasised. The subsequent structural and navigational stages develop as a natural extension from these. The authors, themselves working at a distance, used a collaborative approach during the instructional design process. A variety of learning approaches and underlying learning theories that encapsulated the requirements of online and distance learning and the principles for the teaching of science were considered, including constructivism, problem based learning, situated cognition and cooperative learning, before a strategy and method that best supported meaningful learning was determined. During the development of the learning design solution the relationship between the four stages of the design process was analysed and a refinement of the model proposed.},

abstract={In this article, the authors considered the use of the software Knowledge Forum to complete a curriculum-based project with students enrolled in asynchronous, Web-based Advanced Placement courses in Canada and the United States. Knowledge Forum is an online database that promotes written interaction in a social constructivist environment. The authors investigated how students utilized the system to enhance learning, more so than the in the project's teachers' experiences in traditional environments, at both lower-order and higher-order levels. They found that students effectively interacted as a community and were able to exhibit all of the necessary analytical skills required by the activity.

abstract={Within an authentic assessment regime, a student is evaluated in terms of their ability to demonstrate application of a body of knowledge to a scenario situated in an actual, or a near replica of a real-world context. At Universitas 21 Global (U21Global), a completely online graduate school backed by 16 universities from around the world, the entire pedagogical model is founded on such an approach. One unique feature of the U21Global model is its interactive examination instrument which harnesses the power of the various information and communication technologies (ICTs). This instrument, referred to as the Open-Book Open-Web (OBOW) exam, presents students with a description of a simulated business problem using multimedia. They are then asked to assume a particular role and make recommendations about how to go about solving the problem. Feedback to date indicates that students are generally very positive about OBOW exams. On the minus side, the construction of OBOW exams presents a number of challenges. Not least of these is the steep learning curve it presents for exam authors unaccustomed to working within this paradigm. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

abstract={This study represents an effort to construct a learning framework for knowledge building and collective wisdom advancement in a virtual learning community (VLC) from the perspectives of system wholeness, intelligence wholeness and dynamics, learning models, and knowledge management. It also tries to construct the zone of proximal development (ZPD) of VLCs based on the combination of Vygotsky's theory of zone of proximal development and the trajectories of knowledge building. The aim of a VLC built on the theories of constructivism, situated learning, and knowledge building, etc., is to apply individual intelligence to online learning, bring the advantages of collaborative learning and collective wisdom into play, solve difficult problems in independent learning, and lead to the integration and sublimation of collective wisdom through long-term individual interactions, collaborative learning and knowledge building. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

abstract={Interaction is an essential ingredient in any learning process. However, every interaction does not lead to increased learning. When interaction has a direct influence on learners' intellectual growth, we can say the interaction is meaningful. The precise meaning of meaningful interaction is strongly related to the learning theories underlying the development of particular learning environments. The primary goal of this paper is to re-conceptualize online interaction in terms of meaningful learning based on the learning theory known as social constructivism. Analyzing interaction through this theoretical framework may yield design principles needed to improve the quality of Web-based learning environments. A secondary goal of this paper is to present the implications of meaningful online interaction for researchers and developers. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study investigated the impact of weblog use on individual learning in the context of university senior-level business education. As an emergent form of personal communication, weblogs enable people to publish their thoughts as webpages, and to share information and knowledge. Recognizing the potential impact of weblogs on knowledge expression and sharing, this research sought to empirically examine whether the continuous use of weblogs as online learning logs would affect student learning performance. The assumption was that effective use of weblogs promoted the constructivist models of learning by supporting both cognitive and social knowledge construction, and by reinforcing individual accountability in learning. Results from an Information Systems undergraduate course with 31 participants indicated that the performance of students' weblogs was a significant predictor of the learning outcome (while traditional coursework was not). Moreover, individuals' cognitive construction effort to build their own mental models and social construction effort to further enrich/expand knowledge resources appeared to be two key aspects of the constructivist learning with weblogs. Our results imply the potential benefit of using weblogs as a knowledge construction tool and a social learning medium. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The predominant mode of electronic learning today is 'online' (web-based). This type of learning relies on student access to personal computers - both on and off campus. Mobile technologies offer other educational alternatives. This article defines mobile learning (mLearning) as a new paradigm of flexible learning and describes scenarios for blended learning, which integrates the mobile and the online learning environments. A research model for the study of mLearning adoption is proposed, and hypotheses are derived that allow the study of mLearning adoption from a pedagogical and from a business perspective and can be applied to a variety of learning scenarios.

abstract={Web 2.0 social software offer new pedagogic opportunities to support and empower the Net generation of learners to create their own personal learning agenda and dynamic learning environments. This paper presents learners experiences of using Web 2.0 social software, such as videos and podcasts linked to Wiki contributions in a collaborative online learning environment. In addition to, a private blog which was provided for learner reflections and the University Managed Learning Environment (MLE): which included a private group area and a discussion forum to support the group based assessment. Within the Wiki environment, learners were presented with the learning design by the tutor using text, short videos and podcasts created using Web 2.0 technologies. Learners were given a choice in selecting the most appropriate technology to complete their individual and group tasks and to present these as a group linked to Wiki contributions. This paper outlines the setting up and the implementation of a multi-mode assessed collaborative student learning environment and identifies the different approaches used by learners. Evidence is provided from learners' contributions to the core task captured through the Wiki, and in the form of illustrations of Wiki contributions and images of video recordings. Learner attitude was measured using a pre and post test questionnaire and by students own reflections of their lived experiences captured using a blog. There are some interesting findings including the learners preferred technology for learning, and alternative technologies used which were not provided in this study. In addition, findings are presented relating to what learners did with the different technologies, including student approaches to learning, how the technologies helped or hindered learning and learner attitude to the use of the alternative technologies. These findings will add to the debate on how we engage with and support the Net Generation of learners.},

abstract={This study investigated appropriate pedagogical techniques for workplace e-learning programs in the South African wood products (furniture) manufacturing sector. The study found that learners responded favourably to constructivist teaching approaches, such as asynchronous discussions, open-ended task-based activities, and assignments incorporating authentic, real-world examples. Learners viewed constructivist activities to be more useful than quizzes and traditional essaybased assignments, as they allowed new concepts to be learned in context and were perceived to promote deeper understanding of the subject matter. Nevertheless, they valued the inclusion of a blend of pedagogical approaches in the course design, as this enabled them to approach and analyze new concepts in an assortment of ways. Learners placed importance on regular interaction with other learners and course instructors, and were strongly in favour of including face-to-face components in Web-based courses.},

abstract={Advocates of game-based learning argue that computer games have the potential to transform university education, motivating and engaging a new generation of learners in a way that traditional education does not. However, much of the rationale for this is based on the assumption that games have potential because they are intrinsically motivating to most people. This paper considers the case for using computer game-based learning in Higher Education, focussing on its pedagogic rationale, and presents twelve guidelines to support the design and evaluation of educational games. The development of an online team building game is used as a case study to show how these guidelines can be applied. The assumption that games will revolutionise education because they lead to increased motivation is challenged in this paper. However, it is argued that there is a huge potential for increased engagement in learning through games, but this is only when they are designed for learning and in themselves can be considered to be constructivist learning environments, embodying the principles of problem-based, experiential and collaborative learning. A set of design guidelines for the design of educational games for students in Higher Education, based on existing literature and theories of constructivist learning as well as an analysis of popular online games, are presented and considered. The application of these criteria to the design and creation of a multiplayer adventure game for teaching team working skills is discussed. In all, this paper presents a rationale for the use of certain types of educational computer game in Higher Education and provides a set of practical guidelines for the effective pedagogic and interface design of educational computer games that are suitable for adults.},

abstract={Using today's technologies to study historical events and influential people can go far beyond searching the Web and reporting the findings. Online students can use authentic resources and their own creativity to interpret their findings, demonstrate their knowledge, and make history come alive. Instructors can pose intriguing questions and compelling scenarios that will inspire and motivate online students. Culminating projects that involve research, analysis, original creations, and collaboration add relevance to online classes. WebQuests, and other applicable formats are among the most outstanding examples that contribute to high online retention. This creative approach to instruction is only one of the reasons why the author's university's retention and student satisfaction rates for online programs continue to be almost 100%. Results from a survey of current students and graduates revealed what students and faculty value most about online learning, the most common challenges they face, and proven methods for being an effective online learner, collaborator, and facilitator. Recommendations are based on nine years of efforts by faculty and administrators to find the most educationally sound, administratively efficient, and financially viable way to offer outstanding online learning experiences.},

abstract={This paper discusses an exploratory study to investigate the existence, and nature, of student problem formulation and resolution processes in an undergraduate online Problem-Based Learning (PBL) course in Agricultural Sciences. We report on the use of a content analysis instrument developed to measure problem formulation and resolution (PFR) processes in online asynchronous discussions (Murphy, 2004a, 2004b) to analyze students' text-based, online discussions. The results offer evidence that students do engage in problem formulation and resolution and that these processes appear to be consistent with the PBL process carried out in this course. However, the nature of the PBL pedagogy, at least in this instructional context, ties the PBL problems to be solved tightly to a marked assignment structure and, therefore, appears to restrict the PFR process in its early and late stages.},

abstract={This paper examines a multidimensional set of learning-engagement behaviors by students participating in a community of inquiry. Existing social-inquiry models of learning focus on students achieving shared understanding through solving well-structured problems. These models may not be appropriate for professionally-oriented, graduate online education where students derive distributed and partial understandings of ill-structured, real-world problems. Findings are presented from a study of joint knowledge construction in an online graduate IS management course. Patterns of interactions between learner role behaviors are examined to analyze social engagement in debating course problems. We propose that professionally oriented online courses should frame course problems to reflect students' cognitive and professional learning goals. Student engagement in learning may be intensified by the early identification and encouragement of thought leaders in various domains of professional knowledge who facilitate and complicate community debate. We examine the implications for online learning environments.},

abstract={Faculty from five universities will discuss their groups' respective teaching and learning wikis. The group assembled here represents several divergent approaches and projects to harnessing the collaborative and open-source nature of Wikis to the tasks of teaching, educating inquiry and training. We will discuss and compare Wiki projects that cover diverse methods and content fields. Projects include secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level courses. Systems we describe address groups varying in size from roughly a dozen to hundreds of students. We approach the ontology and pedagogy of Wiki-based educational materials drawing on cognitive and social constructivism, a theory of inquiry-based learning, and an interest in information markets and online sharing dynamics. Projects included in this panel have received financial support from a variety of granting agencies, including the Israeli Internet Association, U.S. National Science Foundation, the GVU Center at Georgia Institute of Technology, SHOHAM at The Open University of Israel, and InfoSoc at the University of Haifa. We created and now study widely different implementations of Wiki usage in education that reflect a variety of instructional approaches. In all of the projects we have completed at least one cycle of use, and can therefore report on outcomes that include user feedback, reactions and satisfaction; impact on learning; impact on grade; non-obtrusive measures of usage patterns; and external measures of quality of the content generated and preserved. Our findings address the issues of design considerations, multilingual and multicultural content, group dynamics, evaluation and quality control. We wish to use this panel to share lessons learned and discuss a variety of usage modes, in search of "best practice" models as well as share lessons learned that apply to future modifications and additions to the code.},

abstract={This chapter examines what criteria, conditions, or characteristics actually constitute a globalized classroom. A graduate course on online education taught in Japan is presented as a case in point. Online mentoring and educational technologies spanning six countries are described. Explanatory frameworks include globalization, constructivism as a cross-cultural pedagogy, cultural attitudes toward the adoption of online technologies, transformative learning, and empowerment. Voluntary feedback from the graduate students, mostly translated from Japanese, provides evidence such as: (a) that mainstream Western constructivism has some universality to be readily accepted by Japanese students, (b) that unfamiliar online information and communication technologies (ICT) are also welcomed, (c) that a positive form of globalization can occur in such a class, and d) that their learning was transformative and empowering. The theoretical framework accounts for the changes which students reported in their attitudes and practices. Thus the class provides a model for realizing the globalized classroom. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.},

abstract={This study employs a case study model to documenting the evolution over three semesters of a Masters course in technology and language learning for in-service teachers using a social constructivist pedagogical approach (Felix, 2002) within an ecological framework, from completely face-to-face (f2f) to predominantly online. The focus is on teachers' acceptance of change in the form of integration of technology into firstly their learning and secondly their teaching, as well as their adaptability to self-managing their learning. The design of the modified course took an experiential modelling approach in which all of the tools and processes that were taught in the course were modelled and experienced by students (teachers) during the semester. These tools include reflective and social computing tools such as chat, blogs, wikis and e-portfolios, as well as lesson and task templating software such as Swarthmore Makers®, Hot Potatoes®, and WebQuests®, and webpage creation software such as Dreamweaver®. Based on grounded research methods, techniques such as surveys, problem-based focus groups and short answer responses were used to ascertain the values of the changes. The information collected from these instruments is presented and compared to the reflective pieces produced by students in their blogs, and the projects they created. © 2006 Hoven, D.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of a field experiment on online examinations facilitated by collaboration support systems. In particular, it examines collaborative learning and virtual teams through online examinations as an assessment procedure, compared to traditional examinations. Assessment is increasingly regarded as an important part of the learning process. Applying constructivism and collaborative-learning theories, the collaborative examination process features students' active participation in various phases of the exam process through small group activities online. A 1 × 3 field experiment evaluated the collaborative online exam compared with the traditional in-class exam, and the participatory exam, where students participated in the online exam processes without groups. Data analysis using results from 485 students indicates that collaborative examinations significantly enhance interactions and the sense of an online learning community and result in significantly higher levels of perceived learning. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The Quality of Working in Groups Instrument (QWIGI) was used in this research to measure students fluctuating psychological need states as well as their situational interest online. Based on previous research with the QWIGI, it was predicted that the variance in university sophomores situational interest in each of the five different topics of an introductory course in education could be explained in terms of the students situational interest in previously studied topicrelated material (both withintopic transfer and acrosstopic transfer) and their perception of the learning conditions. An introductory course on education was taken by 95 sophomores; the course was given by five different teachers, covering five different topics. The course lasted 14 weeks and was set up according to the principles of social constructivism. Students situational interest as well as their satisfaction with the learning conditions in terms of competence level, autonomy granted, and social relatedness was registered on nine occasions during the course. Results indicate that high situational interest generated in the previously recorded learning episode counteracts a decline in situational interest, both within and across the topic boundary. Satisfaction with the learning conditions in terms of the three psychological need states also contributed to the variance explained, particularly satisfaction with the level of competence.},

abstract={Identification of patients with acute illness or patients with deterioration in their condition requires to be both appropriate and speedy, yet this is not always the case (Resuscitation Council (UK) 2005). Specific areas of concern with qualified practitioners centre upon a lack of knowledge in recognition of acute illness, poor communication between staff, inadequate recording of observations, and a lack of a systematic assessment (McQuillan et al 1998; Goldhill, White and Sumner 1999; Peberdy et al 2003; Kause et al 2004).As future registered practitioners, student nurses require to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to address this apparent deficiency. Development of a module to address these gaps is timely and required. The Recognising Acute Illness and Deterioration (R.A.I.D) module was developed in a blended manner, the theoretical underpinnings are taught via WebCT and the students apply this theoretical and research-based knowledge amassed via WebCT to practical skills stations and to scenarios utilising medium fidelity simulators and actor patients within the clinical skills laboratory. This requires students to integrate and apply the theory amassed to a 'near life' situation that is directly applicable to the practice situation, and their actions have an observed result. WebCT utilises a constructivist approach to learning: students use the information accessed to construct their own meaning or understanding of the topic. This approach is relevant to nurse education as nurses have to be problem solvers, evaluators of practice and analyse research in practice (Adams 2004). All students involved have positively evaluated this constructivist and contextual style of learning utilising the blended approach. Development of blended learning modules utilising web-based learning and simulation is an emerging field within undergraduate nurse education. The opportunity to share the lessons learned from development, implementation and evaluation would emphasise the potential this learning and teaching approach has within this field.},

abstract={The knowledge economy and life-long learning have brought the need to support diverse communities of users with different learning needs, preferences and educational backgrounds. It is widely acknowledged that the ability of web-based learning services to deploy information content that effectively assist personalised knowledge construction requires the specification derived from users' information requirements. However, incorporating these requirements to support information content design strategies still remains a challenge. A method rooted in the constructivism and semiotic paradigms is presented in this paper. The method applies Organisational Semiotics techniques to analyse and represent the domain knowledge of personalised information provision in life long learning at the social level, hence assisting the modelling of users' requirements. The method features that users can express their needs, which in turn can be articulated into user's requirements. The user's requirements are captured in a User Requirements Space as they are transformed onto profile. An instance of the user requirements space is then mapped onto an Information Space, which will determine information content selection, their instructive sequencing and appropriate presentation forms. The method will further produce a set of information provision specifications for configuring information packages tailored to users' specific requirements. A case study is used to illustrate and validate the features of the method.},

abstract={The drive for e-learning as a cost-effective and flexible channel for distance and life-long learning has focused on the benefits of a just-in-time delivery of content to the learner. The assumption is that knowledge is inseparable from, and follows, content. An obvious and important aspect of e-learning has been the need for online tutors to deploy a range of Soft Skills to support learners. E-learning relies on e-tutoring: the concept of e-tutoring embodies mentoring, coaching and facilitating techniques. In an online environment in which student discussion forums constitute one of the tools for knowledge construction the role of the facilitator assumes greater importance that of mentor, moderator or coach. The ability to facilitate a discussion or a debate becomes central to the construction of new knowledge for the participants (Holmes et al, 2001) In spring and early summer 2004 a group of teachers from diverse backgrounds engaged in an intensive course in e-facilitation techniques. This paper describes how they learned and were taught, and evaluates the ways in which an online collaborative environment enabled the development of the basic skills required for e-facilitation. The paper then assesses the effectiveness of individuals as both contributors and e-facilitators in a range of online educational forums. It examines the contribution seach made, and details the e-facilitation techniques deployed in various forums. Outcomes are measured against the input that individuals made. The ways in which the participants were able to construct new knowledge in the online communal context are detailed. These are compared with some other models of learning in an online environment: Cuthell (2001); (Salmon (2002). Finally, the paper evaluates the ways in which e-facilitation enables individuals to construct new knowledge, both with and for others. An interesting consequence of participating in a course of this nature is that perceptions of teaching, learning and knowledge change. Do these perceptions follow through into the daily praxis of the teachers? The implications for teaching and learning in a range of educational environments are identified.},

abstract={Narrative analysis has both research and pedagogical advantages for use in CSCL. Narrative theory provides multidisciplinary perspectives and methods from diverse fields. Stories are a way of thinking, making meaning, and showing constructivism in action. This paper discusses the advantages of narrative analysis for interpreting online discourse; presents features, methodological challenges, and procedures; and presents some findings from a case study of online learning. Narrative analysis uses both text and online "talk" to construct a holistic view of the learning experience involving cognition, affect, and interaction. © 2005 International Society of the Learning Sciences.},

abstract={This paper reports on the use of a constructivist approach to the online design and delivery of a first year chemistry course at Swinburne University of Technology during 2004. The transition to tertiary education for most students is difficult but particularly so for those that come to higher education with diverse and disparate backgrounds. Students often have unrealistic expectations of university life, their learning environment and the skills they require to succeed. The engagement of such students presents a continual challenge for teaching academics. In this case study the delivery approach used employed a mixture of both online and face-to-face delivery. Lectures were pre-recorded and delivered using video streaming via the universities Learning Management System, Blackboard™, and CD-ROM. Theoretical concepts and practical skills covered in the lectures were reinforced via face-to-face tutorials and laboratory sessions. Online discussion forums were established to encourage scientific debate and help build a student centred learning environment. Evaluation of the targeted outcomes indicate that issues such as social dynamics, and staff's inexperience with technology, impacted on the student's learning experience more than the diversity of learning backgrounds students came to the course with. © 2005 Marylou Molphy and Catherine Pocknee.},

abstract={This chapter uses a contestatory style of research to challenge a number of our dearly held beliefs about constructivism, drawing on data from a discussion board which was an assessable component of a master's course, EME501: Redefining the Urban-Rural Divide. After reviewing the minimalist and constructivist approaches employed, it looks closely at the kinds of knowledge constructed and the challenges this poses for social constructivism. In particular it looks at the ways existing beliefs and attitudes are reinforced, the maintenance of conservative views, the persistence of gendered knowledge, and the emergence of irreconcilable differences with regard to ICT and the virtual classroom. While not invalidating constructivism as an overall approach to Web-mediated learning, the way in which it is implemented can give cause for concern. © 2006, Idea Group Inc.},

abstract={This article documents the design and pilot delivery of a computer-mediated, competency-based child welfare practice course founded on constructivist instructional principles. It was created in 2003 as part of the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) Social Work program's child welfare specialization stream. Offered to learners via the internet using web-based tools and resources, the course expanded access to the child welfare specialization option for social work students studying at UNBC's three rural regional campuses. The article examines emerging teaching and learning options across four components of online course development and delivery. The background of the specialization stream in the social work program is reviewed, constructivist instructional design theory is summarized, and a rationale for adopting this approach is discussed. This is followed by a brief report on the findings of the formative evaluation of the pilot delivery. Finally, the evolving underpinnings of online instruction are considered, including shifts in the roles of learners and instructors and the role of pedagogy in an evolving educational paradigm. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={The purpose of this article is to describe the development, validation and use of the Constructivist Multimedia Learning Environment Survey (CMLES). This questionnaire assesses teachers' and students' perceptions of the learning environment when students use online multimedia programs while teachers use constructivism as a referent for their teaching. The design of the questionnaire was based on a constructivist approach to learning and focused on the process of learning with the multimedia program and on the nature of that program. Before the use of the CMLES becomes widespread, it was important to determine whether it is valid and reliable. Therefore, a study involving 221 students in 12 high school classrooms into statistical validation and interpretive validation of the questionnaire was undertaken. For this sample of Grade 10 and 11 students who completed the actual and preferred forms of the questionnaire, the CMLES scales demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency reliability (with alpha reliability coefficients ranging from .73 to .82), as well as satisfactory factorial validity and discriminant validity. Therefore, the study supports the reliability and validity of the CMLES for assessing students' and teachers' perceptions of one important aspect in evaluating learning environments which promote the use of multimedia programs and constructivist learning approaches. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={This paper reports the investigation of the effectiveness of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) within a web-based environment in the delivery of an undergraduate Physics course. The effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the performances and the perceptions of the sample students (n=67) using the web-based PBL and comparing the outcomes with those of the web-based Content-Based Learning (CBL). The comparative post-test performance analysis conducted using a student t-test statistical analysis (p<0.05) revealed that the experimental web-based PBL approach yielded better performances than the controlled CBL approach. Where perceptions were concerned, the analysis also revealed that students exposed to the web-based PBL approach responded more positively with their knowledge enhancement compared to students exposed to the web-based CBL approach. © 2005 Shannon Research Press.},

abstract={Traditionally our UK higher education establishments have majored on a lecturer instructing a group of students. The focus has been very much on transferring a body of knowledge to a set of learners using a variety of teaching methods. The target in many establishments has been on the individual learner and their performance. Conversation, when used was a means of clarifying the learning that had been set by the teacher. With the advent of online teaching and learning this mould might be challenged. Can we develop another approach? This article looks at some of the ways in which the design and practices of Talk 2 Learn, an online community, may reflect the thinking of Wenger and Vygotsky. It also begins to explore through the Talk 2 Learn example why it can be a useful addition to the traditional UK higher education models of learning. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract={This paper explores the role of asynchronous online discussion in supporting teaching and learning in Higher Education. It describes three approaches to using online forums: unstructured forums open to an entire cohort of learners; structured forums to which, again, all learners can contribute; and structured forums for group work within the cohort. These approaches are to varying degrees based on principles of social constructivism and community of practice. The literature highlights several constraints on learners and these are explored through a description of the conditions under which forums might best operate. These conditions fall under issues of: curriculum design; tutor support; learners' attitudes and experiences; and software. A case study in which the use of online discussion was pivotal is then considered to illustrate the discussion in the first part of the paper. This case study concerns a distance learning module on E learning. Asynchronous online discussion provided opportunities for interactive group work. This module was well received. All participants took part and there was low threshold to contributing. Any time anywhere access to a permanent store of messages was highly valued. However time was a significant constraint on learners which led to them adopting a strategic approach to participation based on a division of roles. Online group work tended to be task focused, falling short of the more holistic collaborative learning described by some writers. The module could be redesigned to provide more opportunities for collaboration but the case study highlights a dilemma for learners when faced with unlimited opportunities for online discussion alongside very definite limits on time available for study. Hence this paper adopts a tone of cautious optimism in describing the opportunities which asynchronous online discussion provides.

abstract={The ICZM learning model is based on the constructivism theory and the concepts, principles and procedures of Integrated Coastal Zone Management elaborated so as to further knowledge on critical global and regional aspects in the South Western Indian Ocean through networked learning. Understanding the ways in which students use the unique processing capabilities of the computer during the online ICZM module is essential to understanding the influence the computer may have on ICZM learning and to building media theory. From an interactionist perspective, learning with media can be thought of as a complementary process within which representations are constructed and procedures performed, sometimes by the learner and sometimes by the medium. Interactions through asynchronous computer mediated conferencing between the instructor and students and interactions among students with the ICZM online module provided opportunities for an educational transaction. Learning during of the ICZM module occurred through the interaction of three core components: cognitive presence, teaching presence, and social presence. In the delivery of the ICZM online module, one key aspect has emerged clear from the observations made; e-learning need not be seen only as a new medium to deliver distance education contents but needs to be used as a means to bring about a change in the learning methodology using virtual labs within ICT.},

abstract={Devising pedagogical strategies that will engage students in ways which will assure the development of their skills of critique and analysis presents a challenge to tertiary teachers. This paper draws on data from a recent case-based evaluation study to argue that innovative assessment and the development of social presence in online learning environments can contribute to developing skills of critique and analysis in tertiary students. The paper is underpinned by the belief that creative thinking about curriculum issues must continue to lead debates about tertiary pedagogy, the use of educational technologies and online learning. It concludes by posing implications for further research in pedagogical practices in tertiary settings. © 2005, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article describes the design of a collaborative learning tool. The idea of developing a tool for collaboration has been generated through extensive brainstorming and discussions. In this paper author has included the theoretical knowledge underpinning the process of learning through collaboration and the attributes of meaningful learning. A discussion on different types of electronic tools available for learning justifies the need for an appropriate visual tool for collaboration. The author had also realized that none of the digital concept-mapping tools are suitable for online as well as real time collaboration. Hence a conceptual framework for a computer based tool for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration on the web has been envisaged. An illustration with explanation on different features of the conceived collaboration tool for cognitive mapping has been included in this article. This will be a useful tool for online collaboration particularly for a group of people from different parts of the globe.},

abstract={For several years, research on learning technologies has focused on supporting the development of learning environments dealing with content delivery based on various learning paradigms. There seems to be a lack of enthusiasm when the problem of evaluating the effect of assisting technologies to assessment and provision of feedback. This is partly justified by the difficulty in enacting authentic experiences of assessment and feedback mechanisms online. This paper attempts to contribute in the relatively limited literature that deals with the evaluation of learning systems and more specifically computer-aided assessment (CAA). The work discussed in this paper follows on the successful findings of earlier experiments of online assessment concerned primarily with the provision of feedback to participating learners. The paper initially suggests a different perspective for the relationship of the constructivist learning approach to the development of learner-centred learning environments. More specifically the paper outlines the effects of individual and social constructivism to both assessment and communication through feedback. Next the process of establishing a pilot study of an online test for a practical course is described and the findings are reviewed with respect to the role of feedback in Computer-Aided Assessment (CAA). Finally a comparative analysis is made based on the evaluation results of an earlier online assessment experiment for a theoretical course.},

abstract={The value of collaboration as a tool to promote learning is becoming increasingly more evident. Students engaged in collaborative efforts typically retain the information being learned longer by becoming more actively engaged in the learning activity. There is evidence that collaborative activities foster higher-order thinking skills such as analytical reasoning, synthesis, and evaluation. Furthermore, students work in an environment that better prepares them to meet the challenges inherent in succeeding in the workforce. Constructivism in the form or project-based learning has likewise been shown to foster increased retention of material and greater depth of learning. When combined with collaborative assignments, students have demonstrated greater retention and enhanced capability of transferring concepts to practice. Promoting collaboration in a classroom setting is difficult and often resisted by both teachers and students. This difficulty is magnified for courses offered in an online learning environment. Although there are a number of applications available to enable real-time communication, the immediacy and intimacy of person-to-person interaction is difficult to replace. The non-verbal cues that comprise a large part of everyday communication are largely lost through even the richest online environment. As a result, educators are faced with a dilemma: both students and academic institutions are flocking towards courses offered via an asynchronous learning network, but there is no clear understanding of how to foster collaboration, one of the most promising pedagogical tools. Although asynchronous online environments certainly lack the intimacy and immediacy inherent in face-to-face settings and simulated to an extent by synchronous applications, meaningful collaborative assignments are still possible. The proposed paper will detail a five-step systems approach for fostering project-based, collaborative learning in an asynchronous learning environment. The steps will be illustrated with examples from a graduate-level course in multimedia systems in which asynchronous collaboration was a featured assignment.},

abstract={The rapid progress of Internet has equalized information gathering ability and took away the exclusive ownership of information. Common Internet application applied to instruction - learning field is Web - Based Instruction (WBI), which is based on constructivistic educational philosophy. However, WBI is making new types of errors of objectification and unification, which somewhat deviate from the basic education philosophy of constructivism.Jn this paper, we propose a preWBI system, which is subsidiary to WBI system and automatically builds basic knowledge for collaborative learning activity such as problem - solving and subject research studying. We have designed and implemented a preWBI system with Java applet. PreWBI provides useful help for WBI to build database with relevant knowledge, and furthermore it is useful and handy for instruction - learning activity. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Every change or addition of perspective can be seen as a context switch, providing the actor with various navigation paths through a complex, multidimensional information space. This tool will attempt to capture and visualize the increasing amount of information coming available through the tools and standards currently being developed for the semantic web. As such, it may provide the learner means to explore, get to know and interact with her environment, fitting very well in a (social) constructivist approach of learning. © 2004 ACM.},

It uses an enquiry-based learning approach. The learning theories of Piaget, Vygotsky and Schön are integrated with the on-line frameworks of Salmon and Collis et al., together with conclusions drawn from the literature and our own experiences, to produce a design that encourages students to learn through participation, re-iteration, peer-review and reflection.

abstract={This paper discusses the lessons learned from applying a theoretical framework for the professional development of teachers. This framework draws three interrelated theoretical areas: constructivism, situated and distributed cognition, and communities of practice. We first present the theoretical ideas on which this framework is based and discuss two projects that were developed following the framework. We then discuss the lessons learned and present the implications for the design of online professional development. The values of commitment, innovation, assessment, evaluation, communication, and interaction that underpins successful online professional development projects are highlighted. It is argued that using technology by itself does not support professional development; however, using technology in ways that are consistent with constructivist learning, and recognizing that online professional communities of practice can contribute to professional growth is something worthwhile to explore. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Many in nurse education have partially adopted the Internet as a pedagogical approach. This has highlighted serious contentious issues for educators. These include, pedagogical vs. technological approaches to teaching, face-to-face vs. online communication and classroom vs. online teaching. This paper attempts to reassure educators about this new Internet-based pedagogy, by applying traditional educational theories and discussions on curriculum to web-based teaching. In particular, cognitive learning theories such as constructivism and the process model of curriculum development are discussed. These provide a solid theoretical framework from which to expand the Internet-based pedagogical approach among those whose interest is the promotion of learning. The paper concludes with the implications of web-based teaching for the personal and professional development of nurse educators. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Presentation of content, instructor-student and student-student interactions, individual and group activities, and student assessment are each addressed, in turn. The focus is on learning and recognition that, from time-to-time, all students are teachers as they bring diverse expertise, experiences, and worldviews to the task of learning. Reflection on past experiences, interaction with other members of the learning community, immediate instructor behavior, authentic group activities, and diverse assessment tasks with timely and detailed feedback are underscored. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This paper discusses a qualitative participatory action research study, which examined the nature of the cohort learning experience in an online master's program, from both faculty and student perspectives. After describing this online master's program in adult education designed from a social constructivist theoretical frame, this paper discusses two primary areas of findings related to cohort learning. First, were those related to the ongoing negotiation of the learning process: the importance of an opening residential; a consistent but flexible cohort structure; and building ongoing relationships. Second, were those related to the ongoing construction of knowledge: the role of team-teaching and the cohort model in transformative learning; the application of theory to real life practice, and the value of group support and collaboration in conducting research and constructing knowledge. Implications for practice are discussed.},

abstract={This paper is an attempt to define the main features of a new educational model aimed at satisfying the needs of a rapidly changing society. The evolutionary epistemology paradigm of culture diffusion in human groups could be the conceptual ground for the development of this model. Multidimensionality, multi-disciplinarity, complexity, connectivity, critical thinking, creative thinking, constructivism, flexible learning, contextual learning, are the dimensions that should characterize distance learning models aimed at increasing the epistemological variability of learning communities. Two multimedia educational software, Dynamic Knowledge Networks (DKN) and Dynamic Virtual Learning Networks (DVLN) are described. These two complementary tools instantiate these dimensions, and were tested in almost 150 online courses. Even if the examples are framed in the medical context, the analysis of the shortcomings of the traditional educational systems and the proposed solutions can be applied to the vast majority of the educational contexts.},

abstract={This paper discusses the importance of online tutors in the success of e-learning solutions. Since online tutors play a critical role in e-learning, as the main people responsible for the delivery of the courses and the support of the learners, they must be equipped with an appropriate set of skills and attributes in addition to subject matter expertise. Therefore, the process of online delivery according to a sound pedagogical approach is probably one of the most important critical success factors in learner acceptance of e-learning. Furthermore, and in order to be compatible with modern views of academic learning and instructional design, this process often adopts constructivist approaches. The adoption of constructivism is particularly difficult since tutors are not always prepared to take on the role of a facilitator rather than the one of the traditional instructor. This paper discusses this process in this context and suggests a suitable skills set for e-tutors adopting constructivism.},

abstract={We discuss different philosophical views of learning and the consequences of these different epistemologies on the design of online learning environments. Academic learning is proposed as a process of constructing knowledge and the development of reflexive awareness, where the individual is an active processor of information and is therefore proposed as a constructivist process. However, the pragmatic constraints of learning and teaching in higher education (HE) institutions pose clear restrictions on the use of pure constructivism. In fact, modularisation, semesterisation, accreditation needs, modes of assessment, as well as staff and financial limitations, mean that pure constructivist ideals are very difficult to implement and maintain at HE levels. Pedagogical models based on moderate constructivist approaches rooted and constrained by practice, may provide designers and educationalists with more useful and applicable approaches. © 2003 IEEE.},

abstract={The Ecological Engineering community has specific needs, which call for the development of a networked learning environment. The Participatory and Reflective methodology, which is based on a socio-constructivist approach, combining reflective practice, critical constructivism, and architectural design theories, was thought to be the most suitable. This paper presents the fundamentals of this methodology and discusses its application on the design of myNetWorks - an online learning environment for ecological engineers.},

abstract={THIS STUDY set out to identify indicators of constructivist principles applied to the development of Internet-based courses. A peer-nominated panel of nationally recognized experts in constructivist learning theory and instructional technology participated in a 3-round Delphi Web survey, during which they proposed and rated categories and indicators of constructivist-compatible principles. The panel identified a total of 10 categories and 110 indicators of constructivist principles. They rated the importance of 59 of the identified indicators asM=3. 51 or higher (on a 5-point Likert scale). The categories and associated indicators provide an initial framework that may help educators apply constructivist principles to the development of Internet-based courses. They also offer instructors and, in some cases, students a means to evaluate courses. © 2003 Springer.},

abstract={This study investigates the effect of asynchronous, online interaction on student conceptual understanding of light and color. Two versions (N and Y) of an online independent study module on light and color were randomly assigned to students (N = 144) enrolled in introductory science courses for non-science majors at three higher education institutions. Version Y included Internet message boards to facilitate required peer-peer interaction about the module content. Version N lacked message boards. The Light and Color Concepts Assessment Instrument (LCCAI) was administered to subjects in a pre-post test experimental design. A multivariate analysis of variance was calculated, showing that student achievement on two of the four LCCAI test items varied significantly as a function of the module version studied. Analysis of over 500 online postings in light of social constructivism indicated that significant scaffolding took place during online interactions. The authors conclude that the availability of interaction likely played an important role in online learning.},

abstract={Multimedia has the potential of providing bioscience education novel learning environments and pedagogy applications to foster student interest, involve students in the research process, advance critical thinking/problem- solving skills, and develop conceptual understanding of biological topics. Cancer Cell Biology, an interactive, multimedia, problem-based module, focuses on how mutations in protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation by engaging students as research scientists/physicians with the task of diagnosing the molecular basis of tumor growth for a group of patients. The process of constructing the module, which was guided by scientist and student feedback/responses, is described. The completed module and insights gained from its development are presented as a potential "multimedia pedagogy" for the development of other multimedia science learning environments.},

abstract={Business organizations and their employees face ever-increasing complexity and accelerating changes. This brings along the need for training models that can transmit knowledge and skills needed in this kind of environment. Business process understanding is especially required. This article evaluates business games in the light of constructivism, a view of learning emphasizing the need to anchor training to everyday activities and concrete contexts, and introduces a new computer-based business game. The purpose of this construction is to give the business game participants a realistic view of business processes and thus enhance participant business process perception. The primary aim of the construction is to present business processes to game participants by providing a natural representation of the real world and a case-based learning environment that fosters reflective practice. Although this article does not explicitly describe a geographically distributed game case, it introduces a game construction based on Internet transmission protocol that can also be used in a distributed manner. But as such, the article argues for the use of techniques that support continuously processed and Internet-based gaming simulations. © 2003 Sage Publications.},

abstract={This paper criticizes radical constructivism of the Glasersfeld type, pointing out some contradictions between the declared radical principles and their theoretical and practical development. These contradictions manifest themselves in a frequent oscillation between solipsism and realism, despite constructivist claims to be an anti-realist theory. The paper also points out the contradiction between the relativism of the radical constructivist principles and the constructivist exclusion of other epistemological or educational paradigms. It also disputes the originality and importance of the radical constructivist paradigm, suggesting the idea of an isomorphism between radical constructivist theory and contemplative realism. In addition, some pedagogical and scientific methodological aspects of the radical constructivist model are examined. Although radical constructivism claims to be a rational theory and advocates deductive thinking, it is argued that there is no logical deductive connection between the radical principles of constructivism and the radical constructivist ideas about scientific research and learning. The paper suggests the possibility of an ideological substratum in the construction and hegemonic success of subjective constructivism and, finally, briefly advances an alternative realist model to epistemological and educational radical constructivism. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={The effects of changing to an online delivery mechanism within a third year, undergraduate, module have been evaluated against the lecturing staff's intended move towards a student-centred, constructivist learning approach. It has been suggested that this type of delivery can increase critical thinking and active learning for students. In the study described in this paper, qualitative analytical techniques were used in order to explore students' experiences of online delivery. The study addressed their perceptions about online methods as well as the educational implications of their patterns of usage of online resources. The findings suggest that students were quick to overcome anxieties about online learning but generally did not develop any significant degree of discussion. It is argued that a move to online delivery needs a greater attention to design and development of facilitator skills than has been previously recognized.},

abstract={Addressing Carsten and Worsfold's (2000) assertion that online learning eliminates the possibility for "liberal learning," the author of this paper describes the context and guidelines for an online discussion assignment that he used as a faculty member at a liberal arts college. The purpose of this assignment was to help students engage in personal development by examining the ways course content manifested itself in their own lives. After describing the assignment guidelines, the author connects the assignment to numerous theories that are often associated with "liberal arts" learning. This theoretical explication includes connections to the need for a synthesis between the personal and professional selves, notions of constructing knowledge, and online discussion's placement within the writing process. The implication of this article is that the instructional strategies embedded in an online discussion, not the online environment itself, sustains a liberal education.},

abstract={Today, there is growing interest in the use of Internet and WWW to achieve cooperative type activities and in particular, cooperative learning, based on the principles of constructivism. Cooperation can undoubtedly enhance network-mediated instructional systems but efficacious cooperative learning can be ensured providing these systems with components that reproduce well-established pedagogical models of cooperative learning, together with components that can assess both individual and group progress. This is made possible by introducing AI techniques in computer-aided learning systems that allow pedagogical strategies to be embedded. In this work, the authors present a system on the WWW for cooperative learning about geometric figures, where each student communicates with the rest of the group online, and a study to evaluate the cooperative learning effectiveness of our project called Geometriamo. The system is based on Slavin's Student Team Learning model for cooperative learning. © 2002 IEEE.},

abstract={Web-based Instruction (WBI) has been adopted in many educational systems. However, due to WBI’s lack of face-to-face communication existing in a traditional classroom, their effectiveness is minimal. One way to lessen this problem is for these systems to implement a model that provides motivation to students. In this paper, we present a model to support motivation based on constructivism, which is known to be very suitable for WBI. The model is developed according to the four types of interactions: students-teachers, students-students, students-contents, and students-experts. We then describe the implementation of our model and its application to a third-grade science course for demonstration purposes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

abstract={AT LEAST THREE PURPOSES FOR ONLINE TEACHING can be conceptualized: quick dissemination of course information, Web-enabled supplements, and Web-engaged activity. Simply disseminating course information online is necessary for distance courses and promotes efficiency for face-to-face courses, but arguably does not improve learning for either. Web-enabled supplements, however, take advantage of the multimedia nature of the Web, allowing students to research course-related materials previously unavailable or only available in dispersed locations. To promote higher-order thinking, Web-engaged activities can be designed that capitalize on student information processing tools. A major concern of online course management systems is that they emphasize faculty dissemination tools over student processing tools, even though the latter are more likely to promote student interaction and engagement (e. g., debating, sharing data, developing common products, synthesizing information, exploring cases). Online course management systems should be evaluated on the basis of their ability to support planned learning goals and teaching strategies. Currently, many high-level goals and strategies are supported only by individual online tools. Faculty who rely upon integrated course management systems may be unable to involve their students in such activities as community building, research into ill-defined problems, and knowledge construction. If faculty find online course management systems only support information delivery and low-level knowledge comprehension goals, they should seek alternative tools and development options to engender high-level student analysis, synthesis, and evaluation activity. © 2001 Springer.},

abstract={Summary: With over two million students projected to be enrolled in higher education distance learning courses by the year 2002, it is imperative that consideration be given to the design of high-quality online programs. Using the framework of grounded design as a context for dealing with the range of design decisions that best facilitate learning outcomes, five areas are discussed: psychological, pedagogical, technical, cultural, and pragmatic (Hannafin, Hannafin, Land, & Oliver, 1997). Examples are provided of how each area of grounded design can be used, as instructional designers, content experts, and others establish Web-based programs in higher education. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

This trend has caused considerable debate on the positive and negative effects of online instruction in higher eductition (Ellely, Estes, & Forbus. 1998: Rintala, 1998). Student learning is arguably the most important facet of the pedagogical process, regardless of the course dissemination or delivery method.

abstract={Due to its unique characteristics distance teaching can offer invaluable opportunities for working adults to be trained in traditional as well as new forms of online searching. Such training can be offered by Library and Information Science (LIS) schools, private training companies, database or information services, or LIS organisations. Instructional design, the principles of adult learning (andragogics) and constructivistic learning theories should be the point of departure. Distance teaching methods of delivery include print, computer-assisted instruction, audio, video, television, computer-conferencing, e-mail, web-based instruction, or a combination of these. Experience in the distance teaching of online searching at the Department of Information Science at the University of South Africa (Unisa) is used to consider the following aspects of distance teaching in online search skills: computer illiteracy, selection of methods, assessment, support and learning content. The new skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to survive in the complex and dynamic online search environment are also addressed.},

abstract={Although the Internet offers many exciting opportunities for communication and exploration, learning how to use it effectively is a daunting task for novices. The volume of information and its lack of organization present a real danger of cognitive overload. Searching for information is even more frustrating. How can we help novices to search the Internet effectively? One solution is to develop a courseware, using conceptual models based on constructivism, to teach them how to search. This paper describes the process we used to design and develop the conceptual models to teach Internet searching. We begin with a brief review of constructivist learning, mental models and conceptual models. This is followed by the process we used to develop the necessary conceptual models, using the Courseware Engineering Methodology (CEM). Next an evaluation of the conceptual models is given. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.},

abstract={When discussing the current state of the art with regard to the use of new technologies in the foreign language classroom, two issues tend to come up again and again. On the one hand, it cannot be denied that even today, in the so-called post-communicative era, the effects of traditional instructivist theories of language learning with their transmission-based modes of learning are still somewhat dominant, in particular at the grassroots level. This is all the more surprising, as a discussion of constructivism as an appropriate platform for new approaches to language learning and acquisition seems to have dominated the debate at least on a theoretical level in recent years. On the other hand, it is becoming more and more apparent that the available offline and online software tools offer exciting opportunities for the language classroom that cannot be adequately attended to without calling the paradigm of instruction into question. This paper is an attempt to contribute to the ongoing debate on this crucial issue by offering some key principles that move the discussion further in the direction of constructivist learning theories. A few of the theoretical issues discussed in Germany in the context of CALL and TELL are presented. New information and communication technologies will be touched upon, but the main focus will be an assessment of constructivism as the appropriate paradigm for language learning in the new millennium. In addition, the paper considers using Papert's term constructionism as a basis for putting theory into practice and in order to keep separate the theoretical platform of such an approach and its practical implementation in the knowledge society. On a methodological level, construction of knowledge and information processing are regarded as key activities in language learning. In conclusion, template-based learning is discussed as a possible metaphor for the design of technology-enhanced learning materials for the next millennium aimed at providing learners with constructionist learning scenarios. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

However, little research based on educational theory has been conducted to determine how they can maximize the learning potential of this relatively new teaching tool. A constructivist and an objectivist instructional format containing the same information was created and presented online. The online study examines the effect on learning of variables such as age, gender, racial identity, attitude, aptitude, self-regulated learning, and self-efficacy. The only significant interaction showed that older participants perform better using an objectivist approach.

abstract={A quality-based authoring tool is defined by its ability to satisfy its users' needs. In the design and use of such tools in CALL, however, very little reliable information exists about what the tutoring system really does, for example concerning its capacity to create ‘interactive’ lessons. Linked to this, many teachers lack the time and resources to keep up with the latest technological developments, and invariably feel they are under exploiting the possibilities of CALL. This paper proposes a typology of different types of CALL-based interactivity and interaction to help teachers better assess the possibilities of network-based multimedia authoring tools. In adopting a general social constructivist approach, the system of classification looks at how one can link different learning styles, in this case that of Mumford & Honey (1992) Learning Styles, to different types of: (1) online learner accompaniment; (2) evaluation of learner production; (3) organised structures of events/states (scenation); (4) data organisation; (5) information units; (6) frequency of choice; (7) choices made available to learners. Finally, a multimedia authoring system, LEM of Speaker (Intranet version 3.30) will serve as a demonstration of the importance of this mode of evaluation to the design and understanding of such authoring tools in CALL. © 2001, Cambridge University Press.

abstract={This paper describes a project whose aims were to develop a virtual learning environment for collaborative learning. The pedagogy calls on practitioners and newcomers to a community of practice to engage in practical problem solving and dialogue around their practices. The paper agrees with many writers on the subject of computer mediated collaborative work using conferencing, in that good moderation and structure is needed to sustain good learning. The paper describes the concept of workflow in collaborative systems arising from the work of Winograd and Flores, which in turn is based on the notion of speech acts (Searle). This describes a way of structuring the dialogues in conferencing systems. A particular structure "Reciprocal Reading" is described and there is a discussion of the practical outcomes of using such a technique.},

abstract={Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) is a new information technology subject at Charles Sturt University, that develops a learning community and knowledge sharing network for a diverse range of students. By integrating course content about CSCW, students use information environments and groupware products such as e-mail, the Z Object Publishing Environment (ZOPE) and MOO to create learning artefacts. The subject immerses students into social, philosophical and psychological aspects of working in online environments as well as the technology issues associated with being a participant in a workgroup mat can be applied in such fields as professional development, information technology, library science, education, teacher librarianship, health care or policing. Students explore the principles of workgroups, various cognitive frameworks and collaborative tasks (eg. meetings, document generation, argument support and policy work). They learn how to select and tailor a framework appropriate to a specific collaborative situation, and guide the development of workgroup-specific infrastructure. They are also expected to evaluate the effectiveness of workflow, human interaction and knowledge management within an organisation. This paper describes how a team-teaching approach has been structured, and how students and lecturers facilitated each other in regard to course content, methods of instruction, methods of assessment and evaluation. © 2000 ACM.},

abstract={An attempt is made in this paper to outline the commonly reported features of constructivism and collaborative learning as they might underpin a proposed model of ICT support for learning. This model is then evaluated for its use in examining three projects involving ICT in student learning environments. The focus of the proposed model is on the pedagogic issues relating to the design of ICT learning environments, effectiveness of student learning and the wider promotion of ICT inlearning. Encouragement de l'apprentissage de l'enseigné en ligne et hors ligne Dans cet article on cherche à mettre en valeur les aspects du constructivisme et l'acquisition des apprentissages collectifs qui peuvent s'entendre en modèle proposé de support ICT d'apprentissage. On évalue ensuite ce modèle utilisé en examinant 3 projets impliquant les ICT dans l'environnement de l'apprentissage des étudiants. L'accent du modèle proposé est mis sur les aspects pédagogiques relatifs à la conception des enrichissements des ICT, à l'efficacité de l'apprentissage de l'enseigné et la promotion a plus large de ICT dans l'apprentissage. Die Verbesserung von Online und Offline Lernleistung In diesem Papier wird versucht, die allgemein berichteten Eigenschaften von Konstruktivismus und gemeinschaftlichem Lernen in Bezug auf ein vorgeschlagenes IKT-Lernunterstützungsmodell zu umreißen. Der Einsatz dieses Modells wird sodann bei drei Projekten, in denen IKT in die Lernumgebung der Studenten einbezogen ist, evaluiert. Der Schwerpunkt des vorgeschlagenen Modells liegt auf den pädagogischen Aspekten von IKT-Lernumgebungen in Bezug auf ihre Gestaltung, der Lerneffektivität und der weiteren Förderung der Nutzung von IKT für das Lernen. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={An account is given on the use of guided tours' as a complementary addition to conventional lectures in the learning of the basics of informatics. It is claimed that learning can be promoted in the spirit of constructivism, situated action and cognitive flexibility when organizing coursework based on guided tours as well as search engines and directories. Further, an attempt is made to analyze the benefit of optional coursework including the use of guided tours and in addition the use of search engines and directories in the WWW.},

abstract={We thought that the close integration of theory and practice offered by constructivism promises unique opportunities to maximize learning in online courses using interactive software as the primary medium of communication. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the ‘goodness of fit’ between principles drawn from constructivist theories and the design and implementation of the interactive online course. © 1998, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
