abstract={Most current definitions of blended learning refer to a blend of online and face-to-face instruction. It seems that few authors notice the irony that the definition of blended learning does not include the concept of learning at all. The problem with these definitions is that they are devoid of theory and thus lead to trial-and-error research. This paper argues that the definition of blended learning should be built around learning theory and should refer to a blend of direct instruction and learning-by-doing. The paper reports on research conducted to validate a model that puts behavioural and constructivist learning at right angles and considers if the two can occur simultaneously. The model is then placed in the context of a framework of knowledge management and from there a definition is derived that includes context, theory, methodology and technology. © 2020, Academic Publishing Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze six learning theories, beyond those presented in an earlier article by the authors, and discuss their relevance and application in online instruction. Design/methodology/approach: The following databases were used to review the literature on adult learning theories: Academic Search Premier, ERIC and ProQuest. The following key search terms were used in the search process: online instruction, cognitivism, connectivism, heutagogy, social learning theory, transformative learning theory and Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development. The titles of the identified articles were first reviewed for relevance, followed by the abstract, before any further review for suitability for inclusion in this article. Findings: The theory comparison revealed that it is critical to ascertain which learning theory best matches an instructional situation and the background of the learners. The selected learning theories differ in several parameters. The theories were critiqued for their contributions to identified elements in promoting learning. The discussed theories suggest ways to improve online learning environments. Research limitations/implications: Many adult perspectives about learning, while called theories, are largely lacking in evidence leading to them becoming theories. Thus, there remains a need for empirical evidence of these theories and their roles in online instruction. Comparisons of the application of these theories for adult learners in online instruction would also be useful in establishing the effectiveness of the various learning theories in different adult learning situations. Practical implications: This paper provides a theoretical lens for adult instructors and instructional designers in incorporating these adult learning theories appropriately in improving online instruction. Originality/value: This literature review uniquely critiques and compares common adult theories as they apply to adult online instruction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Globally, online learning is widely used as a modern means of delivering instruction. Yet, a significant proportion of online material fails to meet the benchmarks of successful teaching and learning highlighting a need for guidelines on how to structure online materials for effective learning. By presenting learning theories; behaviourism, cognitivism, and constructivism, this paper will highlight and discuss principles that can be applied to online learning contexts. The implications of these principles will be discussed to showcase online learning practices where learning is promoted and learners are actively engaged. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Digital learning aims to build knowledge and shape students' skills in order to enhance the quality of the educational process. Adopting pedagogical theories in educational systems is essential for developing integrated solutions that follow teaching strategies for effective learning and suit to students' needs. To this direction, this paper presents a new approach of applying behaviorist theory in a tutoring system for learning programming languages. Specifically, the presented e-learning system uses Skinner's conditioning as a method of instruction occurring through rewards and punishments for behavior. Through Skinnerian conditioning, students make an association between a particular behavior and a consequence. As a behaviorist theory, great importance is placed on how different patterns of reinforcement have different effects on the speed of learning and extinction. Finally, the first-level evaluation results are encouraging for instructors to use the proposed design in online tutoring. ©2018 IEEE},

abstract={This paper aims at proposing an efficient constructive electronic-based alignment (CeA) to promote self-learning amongst the students via e-learning environment where e-lectures/e-tutorials are developed followed by e-assessments. The CeA is developed based on behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism to ensure the students' learning does take place in the e-learning environment. Considering engineering related courses at higher education, it has been shown that the decline in mathematical background of the students causes difficulties in accomplishing the quantitative curricula. A well-designed constructive alignment is thus necessary to support active learning of the students having different backgrounds. Onsite tutorials and seminars may be helpful; however, they may not be very effective, especially in a large-sized and/or high-diversity class. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed CeA not only helps the onsite students strengthen their knowledge but also provides the offsite students with various kinds of learning supplement. Particularly, a case study is presented to show the potential impact of the CeA on both onsite and online learning of mathematics for postgraduate students in both telecommunications engineering and computer networks. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

It begins with a review of the major theoretical frameworks to date - behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, digital media theory, and active learning theory - to demonstrate the ways in which e-learning is both similar and dissimilar to traditional modes of learning. The article then turns to a practical case study of e-learning, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the American Museum of Natural History and hosted on the Coursera platform. The case study demonstrates both how learning theory affords a template to guide MOOC creation, and how MOOC platforms can be a laboratory for e-learning instructional design. The article concludes with an example of e-learning research, demonstrating the importance of synergy among theory, practice, and research. © 2018, National Research University Higher School of Economics.},

abstract={In general, students give quite a lot of emphasis in their assessment from the University during their studies and they expect transparency and fairness from any assessment process. New technology, and especially the adoption of Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), offers a flexible way for teachers to enhance the role of assessment and feedback in the teaching and learning process. The aim of this chapter is to provide two different online assessment examples and to discuss the learning approaches that were followed and the challenges that both teachers and students faced. In both examples, the same design and delivery process was followed, but each online assessment supported a different way of feedback delivery. This difference in the delivery method was dependent on the learning approaches which were followed by the teachers. In the first example, an assessment was changed from a paper to an online assessment by following behaviourism learning theory. In the second example, online continuous assessments supported a blended learning approach. This investigation was conducted for two years in a UK Psychology School in which the main issue was how to engage a large number of psychology students without overloading staff time and using the University provided facilities. The large student university cohorts had the opportunity to be engaged with their learning process, as different feedback design process supported the learning approach and module characteristics. Different types of questions (multiple choice, ordering, matching, etc.) included in the online tests and different way of delivery feedback supported students to have a more active role in learning by assisting them to develop self-regulation skills. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Purpose: This paper analyzes critically four selected learning theories and their role in online instruction for adults. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted to analyze the theories. Findings: The theory comparison revealed that no single theory encompasses the entirety of online instruction for adult learning; each theory explains some portion of adult online learning; theories are contextual; and components of all theories can be utilized to improve online learning. Research limitations/implications: Adult learning theories and their roles in shaping online learning and instruction deserve more attention. The study of adult learning theories, combined with in-depth analysis of psychological and human resource literature, will enable researchers to delve deeper into the subject. More qualitative studies are needed to explore further how instructors’ ability to utilize theoretical principles can improve online learning. Practical implications: This manuscript offers practical advice to instructors and other practitioners for utilizing adult learning theories for instructional enhancement. Originality/value: This literature review uniquely contributes to filling the gap in human resource development literature by examining selected adult learning theories, comparing them and extending the theories’ applicability and value in online instruction. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper describes the challenges of designing and implementing online group work. We are responsible for a seven-and-a-half week’s online literacy and bi-literacy graduate course in a Bilingual/English as a Second Language (BLE/ESL) Master of Arts program. One of the tasks includes online literacy circle exchanges where students are encouraged to create discourse as joint dialogues and make substantive and meaningful contributions to topics. We offer three figures that visualize types of interactions and exchanges representing potential behavioristic, social interdependence, and constructivism tendencies. We discuss both practical and theoretical concerns to elicit students’ engagement in a learning process, not just students’ interactions in completing a task. Online collaborative group work is discussed and developed through critical aspects of salient literature providing potential for innovative implementation and further contemplation within the profession and online communities of learners. © 2016, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.},

abstract={Background: Research exploring substance use in gay and bisexual men has increasingly paid attention to interpersonal dynamics and relational concerns associated with the use of substances. The current study explored the role of adult attachment style on drug use as well as the potential mediating role of sexual expectancies of substance use among gay and bisexual men. Methods: Online survey data were gathered from 122 gay and bisexual men across the U.S., with a mean age of 33 years. All participants were HIV-negative and identified their relationship status as single. Survey measures included attachment style, sexual expectancies of substance use, and recent drug use. Results: While neither anxious or avoidant attachment were directly associated with the odds of recent drug use, they were positively associated with sexual expectancies of substance use (β= 0.27, p< 0.01, and β= 0.21, p< 0.05) which, in turn, were positively associated with the odds of drug use (expB = 1.09, p< 0.01). Bootstrapping tests of indirect effects revealed a significant indirect relationship between anxious attachment and drug use through sexual expectancies of substance use (β= 0.11, p< 0.05), but not for avoidant attachment. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of interpersonal expectancies as motivators for drug use among gay and bisexual men. Sexual expectancies of substance use were associated with drug use and anxious adult attachment was associated indirectly with drug use through these sexual expectancies. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={In educational discourse on human learning (i.e. the result of experience) and development (i.e. the result of maturation), there are three fundamental theoretical frameworks, - behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism, each of which have been applied, with varying degrees of success, in online environments. An ecological framework of human learning and development in interactive learning environments is proposed. Such an inclusive paradigm organizes the fundamental theoretical assumptions of behaviourism (i.e. automated learning), cognitivism (i.e. recall, understanding, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, creativity, problem solving) and constructivism (i.e. private and shared meaning). Based on review of the literature, behaviourism is best conceptualized as a learning theory; constructivist theoretical assumptions are best applied to cognitive development including private online experience (cognitive constructivism) and shared online experience (social constructivism). Cognitivism is a particularly relevant theoretical orientation in understanding both human learning and development in interactive learning environments. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Little is known about the role of discrete stimulus features in the regulation of fear. This study examined the effects of feature learning on the acquisition and extinction of fear conditioning. Human participants were fear conditioned to a yellow triangle (CS+) using an electrical shock. We manipulated feature learning through differential conditioning. The nonconditioned control stimulus (CS-) was a red triangle in one group (Color-Relevant), but a yellow circle in the other group (Shape-Relevant). Next, two generalization stimuli were tested that shared the shape- or color-feature with the CS+ (a blue triangle and a yellow square). Online shock-expectancy ratings and skin conductance responding showed that the CS- determined the pattern of fear generalization: the same-color stimulus elicited more fear in Group Color-Relevant, versus the same-shape stimulus in group Shape-Relevant. Furthermore, extinguishing these two generalization stimuli had no detectable effect on fear of the CS+. These results show that fear generalization is influenced by feature learning through differential conditioning, and that exposures to different features of a stimulus are not sufficient to extinguish fear of that stimulus as a whole. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The rapid rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) signals a shift in the ways in which digital teaching and learning are engaged in and understood. Drawing upon a comprehensive search of nine leading academic databases, this paper examines the initial phase of MOOC scholarship (2009-2013), and offers an analysis of these empirical studies that conceptualizes themes in MOOC scholarship and locates them within a chronological framework. Two key phases of scholarship about MOOCs are identified, each with associated research imperatives and themes. Phase One: Connectivist MOOCs, Engagement and Creativity 2009-2011/2012. Themes of Phase One include: development of Connectivism as a learning theory, and technological experimentation and innovation in early cMOOCs. Phase Two: xMOOCs, Learning Analytics, Assessment, and Critical Discourses about MOOCs 2012-2013. Themes of Phase Two include: the rise of xMOOCs, further development of MOOC pedagogy and platforms, growth of learning analytics and assessment, and the emergence of a critical discourse about MOOCs. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={As new technologies emerge, more and more people depend on them for a variety of purposes. Now more than ever there is a tendency for technological implications to substitute for face-to-face communication and education. In this paper we attempt to investigate whether the usability and pedagogical factors for quality educational platforms meet the expectations of three dominant learning theories of the past century, which, namely are: behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism. We assign specific factors derived from 9 evaluation models to the 3 learning theories. A list of 15 questions was produced to help evaluators in the assessment of the educational software. Then we evaluated 11 educational websites that aim to help anglophone students improve their language skills e.g. through grammar and spelling exercises. The results show the level of correspondence of these educational websites to the learning theories. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={This paper discusses Keller's ARCS motivational model, its theoretical concepts, and strategies that can be used in an online learning environment. The acronym ARCS stands for Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction. The concepts behind the Attention component of the model discussed in the paper are the ones of curiosity, sensation seeking, and the theory of cognitive dissonance. McClelland's theory of needs, White's competence theory, and the flow theory are the concepts behind the Relevance component. Locus of control, the attribution theory, learned helplessness, and self-efficacy are discussed as a theoretical background of the Confidence component. The theoretical bases of the Satisfaction component are behaviorism, and the theory of equity. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The new instructional design model (Isman - 2011) aims at planing, developing, implementing, evaluating, andorganizing full learning activities effectively to ensure competent performance by students. The theoreticalfoundation of this model comes from behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism views. And it's based onactive learning. During teaching and learning activities, learner is active and uses cognitive learning to constructnew knowledge. To construct new knowledge, educational technology materials are used. These materials areconnected with goals and objectives. This study examines the effectiveness of the instructional design model(Isman - 2011) in developing the students teaching skills (Planning Teaching Domain) by redesign "Generalteaching methods course - curr 233-", which taught to the sixth level students at teachers' college, King SaudUniversity. The sample of the study consisted of 80 students that enrolled in the second semester 2010/2011,they were divided into two groups of 40 students each, (an experimental group and a control group). The resultcomes by administered pre- post teaching skills test to find out the model has strong effectiveness in achievingthe research aims especially in developing the student teaching skills. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={The design of a platform for blended learning is dependent on the educational and didactic theories. We discuss behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism and the impact of these theories on the elements of learning platforms. We describe the construction of a learning platform (of the Dept. of Information Science at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany), developed from the results of the didactic theories. The InfoCenter consists of elements of face-to-face teaching, of multimedia mediation (text books, slides, classic texts, interactive videos, FAQ lists, video glossaries), of Web 2.0 tools (wikis, weblogs, social networks, social bookmarking and folksonomies) and of the use of a learning management system (with learning units and tests). The platform was evaluated by its users (university students) by means of SERVQUAL. According to the evaluation, students are satisfied with the InfoCenter and are willing to use it for their exam preparation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The chapter reviews some of the important guiding issues in the development of animations for educational purposes. Animation is situated as a tool in aid of visualization and the development of mental models. In this perspective, it is argued that animations that are designed for educational purposes should, along with the effort to develop new content knowledge, should also seek to enhance the internal models of the learner. It is argued that this can be best achieved by developing animations that are more explanatory rather than emergent or explorative. The choices made in the design of animations are informed by learning theories: Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Situated Learning. A case is made for using animations in guided rather than open inquiry. Together with the principles of multimedia based on dual-coding theory, cognitive load theory, and schema development, a case is made for what constitutes appropriate design and use of animations in education. It is argued that good animation is one that abides by the research-based principles of multimedia learning, is designed with a mind towards a particular learning theory goal, is used in established protocols that target specific learning objectives, and is one that keeps in mind the possible end-use by the learner. Specific examples of design issues and how these may be resolved by a careful reading of learning theory is discussed. The Inductive Concept Construction (IC2) learning system and how it is guided by the principles of good media design and use is discussed. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Online education (E-Learning) in Latin America, by one side, has been developed widely in the last decade, and also is relevant how educative platforms have obtained significant advances adding innovating technical devices within educational environments such as second life, wimba, e-books, e-boards, etc., that have facilitated students wide access to processes of learning. But in the other side, this type of education has demonstrated some fragmentary advances in the field of didactics, cultural and social curricular adaptation to particular learning communities. Generally, e-learning in Mexico has been oriented by constructivism rhetoric as the main educational approach, while the philosophy and teleology of online education shows clearly a behaviorism background, which it might be more interested in the reproduction of practices instead of intercultural leaning possibilities. The curricular design for these courses, mainly, has done without the participation of scholars and students. This research focuses in the limits that online education has in building an intercultural students and teachers learning community at the universities in Mexico, in a period of 2006-2009. We use a qualitative and a phenomenological approach in order to analyze the different experiences the students and teachers have in facing the curricular and didactic designs of online education and the difficulties and opportunities of socialization while learning and producing knowledge. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In an effort to promote the andragogical teaching model in helping adult learners learn online, the author of this chapter has sought to compare and contrast this model with conventional online teaching model. In doing so, the author argues while conventional online teaching is guided by behaviorism, in order to help adults learn in the online environment, instructors must go beyond the conventional online teaching model characterized by the use of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives and embrace humanism from which andragogy flows. The two models addressed in this chapter were not developed in a vacuum. Rather, they were derived from pedagogical and andragogical assumptions of learners. According to the literature in adult education, pedagogical principles were developed as early as in the 7th and 12th centuries whereas andragogical principles emerged in the early part of the 19th century in Europe. Both pedagogical principles and andragogical principles have been used to guide online adult teaching and learning since universities began to deliver courses in the virtual environments at the beginning of the 21st century. © 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract={Mobile collaborative learning is considered the next step of on-line collaborative learning by incorporating mobility as a key and breakthrough requirement. Indeed, the current wide spread of mobile devices and wireless technologies brings an enormous potential to e-learning, in terms of ubiquity, pervasiveness, personalization, flexibility, and so on. For this reason, Mobile Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning has recently grown from a minor research field to significant research projects covering a fairly variety of formal and specially informal learning settings, from schools and universities to workplaces, museums, cities and rural areas. Much of this research has shown how mobile technology can offer new opportunities for groups of learners to collaborate inside and beyond the traditional instructor-oriented educational paradigm. However, mobile technologies, when specifically applied to collaborative learning activities, are still in its infancy and many challenges arise. In addition, current research in this domain points to highly specialized study cases, uses, and experiences in specific educational settings and thus the issues addressed in the literature are found dispersed and disconnected from each other. To this end, this paper attempts to bridge relevant aspects of mobile technologies in support for collaborative learning and provides a tighter view by means of a multidimensional approach. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the usability and interface design of e-learning portal developed for primary schools in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach Using Singapore-based learning EDvantage (LEAD) portal as a case study, this paper reviews and analyses the usability and usefulness of embedded learning objects (LOs) for students aged nine years and above through learning theories such as behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism and interface design theories by Shneiderman, LO review instrument and laws of gestalt psychology. Findings Analysis found the portal to be sufficiently motivating and appealing to learners at Piaget's concrete operations stage. The interface design is universally structured and functional. An area for improvement highlighted in this case study is the lack of explicit mention of learning outcomes in the portal. Practical implications Usability principles used in this case study should be provided by the Ministry of Education in Singapore to schools to ensure more standardized and rigorous selection process of e-learning portals. Originality/value This evaluation provides schools with insights into the use of learning theories and usability principles for evaluation of learning objects designed for primary-going students. It aims to inform decision makers of issues in interactive design to consider before subscribing to any e-learning portals. It also provides a gauge of current usability level of commercially developed portals as usage of such portals continue to proliferate in the Singapore education system. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},
