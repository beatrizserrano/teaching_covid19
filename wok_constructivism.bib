Title = {{I don't need peer support: effective tutoring in blended learning
   environments for part-time, adult learners}},
Journal = {{HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT}},
Abstract = {{Given the rise of social media engagement within society, there are
   challenges for tutors in blended and online contexts to provide
   opportunities for social constructivist learning experiences within
   their institutional learning environments. This article proposes a
   module approach to teaching, learning and assessment for learners
   undertaking part-time, vocationally related degrees. A mixed methods
   approach was adopted to conduct a detailed exploration of eight tutors'
   practice with data gathered from three principal sources. Interviews
   with tutors explored their approaches to delivery and considered factors
   that impacted on quality; students' perceptions of their learning
   experiences were assessed using an attitude survey; and an analysis of
   the content and communications in the virtual learning environment
   provided insight into tutors' online practice. Analysis of modules
   suggested limited online peer-to-peer interaction, with tutors noting
   the difficulties of promoting engagement. The article argues for a
   constructivist approach in this context with a need for tutors to
   promote a simple module structure, focused around assessment, that
   creates space for learning. This structure appeared appropriate for
   these learners, enabling them to manage the influence of daily events,
   together with pressures and time constraints of work. The findings could
   aid tutors in designing and delivering courses for similar groups of
   learners.}},

Title = {{Constructivism, curriculum and the knowledge question: tensions and
   challenges for higher education}},
Journal = {{STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{In recent times, there has been a strong focus on moving university
   teaching away from a so-called `instructivist', lecture-centred mode, in
   which the focus is on what teachers are doing, towards a more
   student-centred `constructivist' approach, centred on active learning
   and students' own constructions of knowledge. This paper considers the
   tensions and challenges raised by the ways in which constructivist ideas
   are being taken up in higher education, highlighting two particular
   issues (1) the positioning of curriculum knowledge as settled and easily
   transferable across modes of teaching; and (2) the neglect of important
   disciplinary differences as a result. These issues are explored in
   relation to two particular case studies of universities introducing new
   online learning reforms. These case studies show the problems
   potentially raised by the limited attention to curriculum in the push
   for more constructivist pedagogies, including a limited interpretation
   of what constructivist teaching entails and an inattention to the
   conditions required for its practice.}},

Abstract = {{Aim/Background: Pharmacy educators often incorporate electronic learning
   or e-learning to facilitate learning among pharmacy students. E-learning
   can be designed based on the Social Constructivism Theory (SCT). The
   learning outcomes of e-learning that is developed based on the SCT
   should be assessed continuously and they should include the evaluation
   of students' perceptions on the Social Constructivist Learning
   Environment (SCLE) of their e-learning. The present study aims to
   investigate pharmacy students' expectations for their e-learning and
   evaluate the extent to which e-learning fulfils their expectations.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among the second- and
   third-year undergraduate pharmacy students in a Malaysian Public
   University to assess the students' perceptions on the SCLE of two
   e-learning components offered in two core courses: Principle of
   Pathology (PP) and Pharmaceutical Care (PC) using the Constructivist
   Online Learning Environment Survey (COLLES). Results: All students who
   were invited to participate in the study responded to the survey
   (response rate = 100\%, n = 336). In general, students had positive but
   moderate expectations and satisfaction towards e-learning. Students
   mostly expected e-learning to be relevant to their professional
   practice. The second-year PP students were satisfied with their
   e-learning, but the third year PC students rated their experience to be
   lower than their expectations. Conclusion: As a conclusion, although
   e-learning that was developed based on the SCT can resulted in SCLE, the
   expectations of the third-year pharmacy students were harder to fulfil
   compared to their younger counterparts. This warrants innovation in
   e-learning content and processes for the third-year students.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of technology use in education: Findings from a critical
   analysis of systematic literature reviews}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING}},
Abstract = {{Because the educational technology research literature is so broad, it
   is difficult for researchers to acquire an accurate sense of the issues
   and trends across the entire field. There has not been any recent effort
   to synthesize or critically analyse the systematic reviews in the area
   of educational technology. This study analysed 73 systematic literature
   reviews, including meta-analyses, focused on the evaluation of
   technology in educational contexts, in order to holistically understand
   the impact of learning technology use across different aspects of
   evaluation. Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was
   learning outcomes (89\%), followed by affective elements (45\%),
   behaviours (25\%), technological elements (21\%) and
   teaching/pedagogical aspects (19\%). Most of the reviews found that the
   use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions.
   Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism,
   student-centred learning and feedback were most effective. The analysis
   highlighted the need for more reviews focusing on multiple aspects of
   learning technology evaluation, on school level education and on the use
   of technology in naturalistic (non-interventional) settings. Critical
   reflections are also cast on the methods used to conduct systematic
   reviews in the educational technology field.}},

Abstract = {{Online and mobile learning resources are becoming more important in
   higher education as students expect more flexibility and diversity in
   the educational tools and resources they can access. One of these online
   resources is educational podcasts. Podcasts offer educators and students
   a unique way to convey and learn about new information related to an
   academic subject. Educational podcasts can be classified under different
   learning styles, strategies, and pedagogies, such as e-learning or
   hybrid learning, Constructivism, the scaffolding technique, supplemental
   tools, and cooperative learning. Past literature demonstrates a demand
   for educational podcasts from both educators and students. The purpose
   of this study was to perform an exploratory analysis on the use of
   podcasts in higher education, and to determine the effectiveness of
   these podcasts on enhancing student learning in a Sport Management Event
   and Facilities Management class. The research questions we were looking
   to answer are: Did the podcasts affect student learning? Did the
   podcasts influence student motivation? And finally, how useful were the
   podcasts? The results showed that the participants in this study had an
   overall positive learning experience from listening to the podcasts, and
   that students fell in between being unmotivated and moderately motivated
   to listen to the podcasts. The student population, overall, reported
   being in favor of using the podcasts. The findings from this study help
   reinforce previous findings about the usefulness and positive learning
   outcomes from the use of podcasts but highlight the need for instructors
   to find ways of improving student motivation to use podcasts.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying and fulfilling adult learners' needs is critical to
   instructional designs aimed at enhancing their achievement and
   self-empowerment. In reviewing different theories and perspectives on
   adult learning and online and blended learning (OBL), it is noteworthy
   that there is not a comprehensive framework to guide the design of OBL
   environments that meet adult learners' needs, and that are underpinned
   by adult learning theories, online knowledge construction, motivational
   theories, and technological acceptance models. In this respect, the
   theory of existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) (Alderfer, 1972) is
   applicable to interpret different types of needs to sustain learning
   motivation. Employing the ERG theory as the overarching framework, the
   purpose of this paper is to capture adult learners' needs from both
   positivist and subjectivist perspectives. In other words, the identified
   needs are to help adult learners optimally perform the learning
   activities designed to achieve the learning goals on the one hand, and
   to sustain their motivation during the learning process on the other
   hand. Thus, the framework is helpful for practitioners, curriculum
   developers, and researchers who are in search of a theoretical
   background for both instructional design and empirical investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Videoconferencing as a learning tool has been widely used among
   educators and learners in order to induce effective communication
   between learners and teachers or learners and their peers, especially
   when face-to-face means are not possible. Different types of
   videoconferencing platforms or systems have emerged for use in today's
   higher education institutions. Previous research has focused on
   examining the potential of three different forms of videoconferencing
   systems: desktop videoconferencing (DVC), interactive videoconferencing
   (WC), and Web videoconferencing (WVC). In this study, a review of the
   literature was conducted to increase the current knowledge regarding the
   use of these videoconferencing systems. A classification of the
   videoconferencing paradigms from the constructivism and cognitivism
   perspectives was provided. The summary of the results for these
   videoconferencing systems revealed specific learning opportunities,
   outcomes, and challenges for both learners and instructors. The results
   suggest that current policy and teaching strategies are not ready to
   provide an accessible and comprehensive learning experience in DVC and
   IVC. Relative to previously conducted studies regarding the use of
   videoconferencing in higher education, this study offers a broader
   consideration of relevant challenges that emerge when using certain
   videoconferencing systems in both learning and teaching situations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An extensive and international evidence base positions
   professional learning communities (PLCs) as an effective continued
   professional development (CPD) mechanism that can impact on teachers'
   practices and, in turn, students' learning. The landscape of teacher
   PLCs is continuously developing; notably through teachers' uses of
   social media. Yet, there is limited robust evidence identifying the
   characteristics of social media PLCs that impact on teachers' learning
   and practice. Purpose: This exploratory study examined the
   characteristics of a specific Twitter-based professional learning
   community - \#pechat. The research questions were: (i) what is the
   nature of a Twitter-based professional learning community? and (ii) what
   characteristics of a Twitter-based professional learning community
   develop learning and practice? Methods: Data were generated from 901
   tweets between 100 participants; and 18 in-depth semi-structured
   elicitation interviews with participants and moderators of the
   Twitter-based professional learning community. Data were analysed
   through a process of deliberation, and a relativist approach informed
   quality. Findings: Two themes are reported to explain the nature of the
   Twitter-based professional learning community and the different types of
   characteristics of \#pechat that developed learning and practice. The
   first theme engagement shows how different participants of \#pechat
   engaged with discussions and how moderators played a key role in
   facilitating discussions between participants. The second theme shared
   practices shows how discussions between participants of \#pechat led to
   the development of new practices that some teachers were able to use to
   accomplish particular objectives in their physical education lessons.
   Conclusion: The analysis of the data provided evidence to suggest that
   \#pechat is a PLC and is representative of an established group of
   practitioners. These characteristics should be considered in the design
   of future online professional development experiences. Facilitator or
   moderator training could support the development of social media based
   PLCs that subsequently and positively impact on teachers' practices.}},

Abstract = {{Billiards is a sport that not only requires numerous skills, but also
   emphasizes the strategies of planning the path of the contact and shot.
   Traditional billiards training mainly focuses on skills practicing,
   while the strategies for facing different kinds of challenges in
   billiards competitions are usually ignored. Therefore, referring to
   social constructivism, the current study proposed an ASQ1 (annotation,
   summarizing, questioning and interflow) mobile flipped learning approach
   to strengthen students' pre-class learning effectiveness via engaging
   them in social interaction contexts to share experience and strategies
   of dealing with different billiards competition cases. An experiment was
   conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
   participants were 80 university students from two classes; one class
   learned with the ASQ1 mobile flipped learning approach while the other
   adopted the traditional flipped learning approach. The results showed
   that ASQ1 could significantly enhance students' billiards skills
   performance and online learning engagement with no influence on task
   load. In addition, according to the students' feedback, ASQ1 could help
   students ``make effective use of strategies, ``improve learning
   performance{''} and ``promote reflection.{''}}},

Abstract = {{The extensive use of social media has encouraged university teachers to
   consider employing social media as new e-learning platforms. This study
   explored the relationship between social media usage and constructive
   learning performance (perceived group task performance). Specifically,
   this work focused on the mediating role of communication in group and
   the moderating role of tie strength in online social networking. Survey
   data were collected from students in a senior-level business course.
   Students were asked to express their opinions on Facebook usage,
   communication in group, tie strength, and group performance. SmartPLS
   was used as the major data analysis tool. Results revealed that frequent
   social media usage of students led to increased communication among
   group members and that communication in group enhanced the perceived
   group task performance of students. Finally, tie strength negatively
   moderated the relationship between social media usage and communication
   in group.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural heritage institutions are spending considerable effort and
   resources to provide online access to their collection catalogues and
   collection management systems, usually through their institutional
   websites. This improves accessibility and supports research and
   engagement by diverse user groups, as well as meeting the increasing
   expectation by audiences that this type of information will be freely
   and easily available online. However, cultural organisations have not
   responded to these needs in the same way and have been employing
   different web tools and features to present their collections online. In
   this article, we argue that the technological implementation choices and
   the type of content provided reflect also the philosophy of
   communication of the institution itself. We used the constructivist
   approach's learning theory and theory of knowledge and combined these
   interrelated epistemological and cognitive perspectives to analyse the
   communication philosophy of a large number of museum online catalogues.
   The article presents the research carried out initially in 2007 through
   2009 and then again in 2017, studying the provision of collections
   information online by different types of museums across Europe and in
   the United States. This enabled us to establish categories of
   presentation types and study the changes over time. The results
   highlighted the major shift towards participatory practices which have
   been transforming the cultural heritage world over the past years.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aimed to alleviate the disparity in the literature regarding
   social media use for collaboration and communication and its influence
   on the performance of students at higher education. A questionnaire
   survey on constructivism theory, technology acceptance model, and
   communication theory were utilized as the key method for collecting data
   and was circulated among a total of 863 university students. The
   obtained outcomes of students' behavioral intention to utilize social
   media to collaborate learning and online communication indicates a
   positive effect on their academic works in higher education institutes,
   while male students were not completely satisfied with interaction with
   peers for collaboration learning. The study indicates that collaboration
   learning, as well as online communication over social media enhances,
   the students learning activities and enable to sharing knowledge,
   information, and discussions, and hence, we recommend students to
   utilize social media for education purpose and should have encouraged
   them through lecturers at higher level education institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Although MOOCs have not lived up to previously breathless predictions of
   disruption, they have had an outsized influence on university
   administrators who see online learning as a savior solution for
   ever-shrinking budgets. Despite lower student persistent rates, faculty
   skepticism, and burdensome faculty workloads, the general public and
   administrative embrace of online learning has been enthusiastic, which
   may be explained in part using Foucault's concept of the episteme to
   view the convergence of the parallel tracks of educational and
   technological development--the idea of a kind of mechanism for learning.
   While MOOCs once promised best professors, other institutions now
   promise the best designed mechanisms for learning, certified through
   corporatized quality assurance programs and learning management systems.
   While this may be appropriate for shopping educational products in a
   neoliberal marketplace, it seldom addresses human needs. Moreover, the
   temporal and human constraints that online promises to banish, in fact,
   continue to exist. Therefore, a more realistic examination of
   psychological and social factors, pedagogical tools, and the nature of
   online communication, is needed in order to create a more humane way of
   teaching, and learning.}},

   formalism skills who had participated in peer-led team learning (PLTL)
   and cyber peer-led team learning (cPLTL), a synchronous online version
   of peer-led team learning (PLTL) workshops. A new electron-pushing
   formalism analytic framework was developed from a review of the
   literature in addition to analysis of students' interview artifacts,
   using a constant-comparison process. Utilization of this new
   electron-pushing formalism analytic framework for coding student
   interview artifacts revealed that cPLTL students were significantly less
   likely to successfully draw the product suggested by the curved arrows
   than their PLTL classmates. Implications for instructors are suggested,
   including encouraging students to verbally explain their rationale while
   drawing mechanisms as well as optimizing graphical collaborative
   learning activities for online learners.}},

Abstract = {{Teachers face multifaceted challenges regarding access to quality
   professional development. Although technology is increasingly utilized
   to address this concern, access alone does not ensure effective OTPD.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine teachers'
   perceptions of the design and implementation of a job-embedded OTPD
   experience. Supported by adult learning theory and social
   constructivism, this qualitative multi-case study utilized within-case
   and cross-case analysis to examine results. These findings, presented
   through teachers' voices, included explicit and empirical evidence of
   six OTPD design and implementation features that address multiple gaps
   in the extant literature and contribute to an OTPD framework. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{The increasing use of digital systems to support learning leads to a
   growth in data regarding both learning processes and related contexts.
   Learning Analytics offers critical insights from these data, through an
   innovative combination of tools and techniques. In this paper, we
   explore students' activities in a MOOC from the perspective of personal
   constructivism, which we operationalized as a combination of learning
   behaviour and learning progress. This study considers students' data
   analyzed as per the MOOC Process Mining: Data Science in Action. We
   explore the relation between learning behaviour and learning progress in
   MOOCs, with the purpose to gain insight into how passing and failing
   students distribute their activities differently along the course weeks,
   rather than predict students' grades from their activities.
   Commonly-studied aggregated counts of activities, specific course item
   counts, and order of activities were examined with cluster analyses,
   means analyses, and process mining techniques. We found four meaningful
   clusters of students, each representing specific behaviour ranging from
   only starting to fully completing the course. Process mining techniques
   show that successful students exhibit a more steady learning behaviour.
   However, this behaviour is much more related to actually watching videos
   than to the timing of activities. The results offer guidance for
   teachers.}},

Abstract = {{Following theoretical frameworks including social-cognitive theory,
   constructivism and creating collaborative learning community, this
   correlational study elucidates the community of inquiry framework in
   regard to self-regulation, metacognition, and motivation in an online
   learning setting. Data were collected from 1535 students enrolled to an
   online Information and Communication Technology-I course offered by the
   Department of Informatics at a well-known public university. The data
   were collected online through Survey Monkey and then analyzed with
   descriptive and inferential statistics using multiple linear regression
   analysis through SPSS version 23 statistical software. The findings
   notably revealed that self-regulation, metacognition, and motivation
   significantly contributed to the prediction of community of inquiry and
   its three presence types. The findings highlighted the importance of
   self-regulation for overall community of inquiry and its three presence
   types due to its significantly valuable contribution. This study
   resulted in a new tentative model, adding a new construct of regulatory
   presence, addressing learners' self-regulation. Further research could
   concentrate on this new tentative model in addition to the new
   construct.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the conceptualisation and development of a
   pedagogical framework to support the design of e-books for children to
   enhance literacy development. It emerged from research undertaken within
   the Q-Tales international consortium project of the EU's Horizon 2020
   Programme for Research and Innovation, where the aim was to facilitate
   key stakeholders to collaborate and participate in the online production
   and publication of high-quality, educational e-books for children. The
   pedagogical framework described here sought to answer the question What
   concepts and principles undergird the effective design of pedagogically
   impactful e-books for children? It is grounded by the theoretical
   underpinnings of socio-constructivism, constructionism and skill theory,
   and how they relate to children's literacy development. A framework
   describing different narrative forms and component features, key
   pedagogical activities appropriate for different stages of reading
   development and design recommendations regarding the integration of
   multimedia into e-books are also central to the pedagogical framework.
   As well as informing the design of the Q-Tales infrastructure for
   children's e-book design and publication, we hope the guidelines and
   pedagogical activities enumerated here will be widely useful for those
   designing and developing digital, interactive narratives, particularly
   e-books to enhance children's emerging literacy.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: ``Flipped{''} instructional sequencing is a new
   instructional method where online instruction precedes the group
   meeting, allowing for more sophisticated learning through discussion and
   critical thinking during the in-person class session; a novel approach
   studied in this research.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to document dental students'
   perceptions of flipped-based blended learning and to apply a new method
   of displaying their perceptions based on Likert-scale data analysis
   using a network diagramming method known as an item correlation network
   diagram (ICND). In addition, this article aimed to encourage
   institutions or course directors to consider self-regulated learning and
   social constructivism as a theoretical framework when blended learning
   is incorporated in dental curricula.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty (second year) dental students at a
   Northeastern Regional Dental School in the United States participated in
   this study. A Likert scale was administered before and after the
   learning experience to obtain evidence of their perceptions of its
   quality and educational merits. Item correlation network diagrams, based
   on the intercorrelations amongst the responses to the Likert-scale
   items, were constructed to display students' changes in perceptions
   before and after the learning experience.
   Results: Students reported positive perceptions of the blended learning,
   and the ICND analysis of their responses before and after the learning
   experience provided insights into their social (group-based) cognition
   about the learning experience. The ICNDs are considered evidence of
   social or group-based cognition, because they are constructed from
   evidence obtained using intercorrelations of the total group responses
   to the Likert-scale items.
   Conclusions: The students positively received blended learning in dental
   education, and the ICND analyses demonstrated marked changes in their
   social cognition of the learning experience based on the pre-and
   post-Likert survey data. Self-regulated learning and social
   constructivism are encouraged as useful theoretical frameworks for a
   blended learning approach.}},

   The study is set at an online course with convergent media, where
   students analyze industrial processes related to industrial chemistry.
   The methodology is qualitative with case study; the results show that
   the cognitive-linguistic skills of students, synchronously and

Abstract = {{Background: Both nationally and internationally concerns have been
   expressed over the adequacy of preparation of undergraduate nurses for
   the clinical skill of wound care. This project describes the educational
   evaluation of a series of Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) as a blended
   learning approach to facilitate undergraduate nursing students learning
   of wound care for competence development. Constructivism Learning Theory
   and Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning informed the design of the
   RLOs, promoting active learner approaches. Clinically based case studies
   and visual data from two large university teaching hospitals provided
   the authentic learning materials required. Interactive exercises and
   formative feedback were incorporated into the educational resource.
   Methods: Evaluation of student perceived learning gains in terms of
   knowledge, ability and attitudes were measured using a quantitative pre
   and posttest Wound Care Competency Outcomes Questionnaire. The RLO CETL
   Questionnaire was used to identify perceived learning enablers.
   Statistical and deductive thematic analyses inform the findings.
   Results: Students (n = 192) reported that their ability to meet the
   competency outcomes for wound care had increased significantly after
   engaging with the RLOs. Students rated the RLOs highly across all
   categories of perceived usefulness, impact, access and integration.
   Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that the use of RLOs for
   both knowledge-based and performance based learning is effective. RLOs
   when designed using, clinically real case scenarios reflect the true
   complexities of wound care and offer innovative interventions in nursing
   curricula.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the connection between students'
   perceived constructivist learning environment and their involvement in
   activities unrelated to class work via social media engagement (SME),
   while considering the moderating role of their openness to diversity and
   challenge (ODC) in explaining both variables. Another aim was to measure
   the impact of SME on students' achievement (GPA). Data were gathered
   from 271 undergraduate students. According to the structural equation
   modeling results, a negative coefficient result was shown between the
   perception of the learning environment as constructivist and SME
   constructs. ODC was found positively connected to both variables. The
   students' GPA was mainly explained by their cultural affiliation.
   Implications of these findings and directions for future research are

Abstract = {{The new guidelines for science education emphasize the need to introduce
   computers and digital technologies as a means of enabling visualization
   and data collection and analysis. This requires science teachers to
   bring advanced technologies into the classroom and use them wisely.
   Hence, the goal of this study was twofold: to examine the application of
   web-based technologies in science teacher preparation courses and to
   examine pre-service teachers' perceptions of ``cloud pedagogy{''}-an
   instructional framework that applies technologies for the promotion of
   social constructivist learning. The study included university teachers
   (N = 48) and pre-service science teachers (N = 73). Data were collected
   from an online survey, written reflections, and interviews. The findings
   indicated that university teachers use technologies mainly for
   information management and the distribution of learning materials and
   less for applying social constructivist pedagogy. University teachers
   expect their students (i.e., pre-service science teachers) to use
   digital tools in their future classroom to a greater extent than they
   themselves do. The findings also indicated that the ``cloud pedagogy{''}
   was perceived as an appropriate instructional framework for contemporary
   science education. The application of the cloud pedagogy fosters four
   attributes: the ability to adapt to frequent changes and uncertain
   situations, the ability to collaborate and communicate in decentralized
   environments, the ability to generate data and manage it, and the
   ability to explore new venous.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in our global world have shifted the skill demands from
   acquisition of structured knowledge to mastery of skills, often referred
   to as twenty-first century competencies. Given these changes, a
   sequential explanatory mixed methods study was undertaken to (a) examine
   predominant instructional methods and technologies used by teacher
   educators, (b) identify attributes for learning and teaching in the
   twenty-first century, and (c) develop a pedagogical framework for
   promoting meaningful usage of advanced technologies. Quantitative and
   qualitative data were collected via an online survey, personal
   interviews, and written reflections with science teacher educators and
   student teachers. Findings indicated that teacher educators do not
   provide sufficient models for the promotion of reform-based practice via
   web 2.0 environments, such as Wikis, blogs, social networks, or other
   cloud technologies. Findings also indicated four attributes for teaching
   and learning in the twenty-first century: (a) adapting to frequent
   changes and uncertain situations, (b) collaborating and communicating in
   decentralized environments, (c) generating data and managing
   information, and (d) releasing control by encouraging exploration.
   Guided by social constructivist paradigms and twenty-first century
   teaching attributes, this study suggests a pedagogical framework for
   fostering meaningful usage of advanced technologies in science teacher
   education courses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the characteristics and behaviour of learners on
   nine Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the FutureLearn platform in
   2014 and 2015. FutureLearn's social constructivist approach, which
   emphasizes learning through social interaction, makes the focus on forum
   posting within these MOOCs particularly appropriate. This study makes a
   significant contribution to the research on MOOCs by exploring first the
   extent to which learners on FutureLearn MOOCs make comments, second,
   whether groups of learners who comment to a lesser or greater extent
   have different demographic characteristics and third, whether commenting
   activity is associated with MOOC completion. The study uses a large
   dataset of over 25000 learners to examine learners who comment versus
   those who do not, and learners who generate many posts. The results show
   that learners who are older, work part-time or not at all are more
   likely to post a comment, and those who are older, work part-time or not
   at all, are better educated and have prior online experience make the
   most comments. Making comments is also strongly associated with

Abstract = {{Background: Sex and Gender Medicine is a novel discipline that provides
   equitable medical care for society and improves outcomes for both male
   and female patients. The integration of sex- and gender-specific
   knowledge into medical curricula is limited due to adequate learning
   material, systematic teacher training and an innovative communication
   strategy. We aimed at initiating an e-learning and knowledge-sharing
   platform for Sex and Gender Medicine, the eGender platform
   (http://egender.charite.de), to ensure that future doctors and health
   professionals will have adequate knowledge and communication skills on
   sex and gender differences in order to make informed decisions for their
   patients.
   Methods: The web-based eGender knowledge-sharing platform was designed
   to support the blended learning pedagogical teaching concept and follows
   the didactic concept of constructivism. Learning materials developed by
   Sex and Gender Medicine experts of seven universities have been used as
   the basis for the new learning tools. The content of these tools is
   patient-centered and provides add-on information on gender-sensitive
   aspects of diseases. The structural part of eGender was designed and
   developed using the open source e-learning platform Moodle. The eGender
   platform comprises an English and a German version of e-learning
   modules: one focusing on basic knowledge and seven on specific medical
   disciplines. Each module consists of several courses corresponding to a
   disease or symptom complex. Self-organized learning has to be managed by
   using different learning tools, e.g., texts and audiovisual material,
   tools for online communication and collaborative work.
   Results: More than 90 users from Europe registered for the eGender
   Medicine learning modules. The most frequently accessed module was
   ``Gender Medicine-Basics{''} and the users favored discussion forums.
   These e-learning modules fulfill the quality criteria for higher
   education and are used within the elective Master Module ``Gender
   Medicine-Basics{''} implemented into the accredited Master of Public
   Health at Charite-Berlin.
   Conclusions: The eGender platform is a flexible and user-friendly
   electronical knowledge-sharing platform providing evidence-based
   high-quality learning material used by a growing number of registered
   users. The eGender Medicine learning modules could be key in the reform
   of medical curricula to integrate Sex and Gender Medicine into the
   education of health professionals.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL NURSING}},

Abstract = {{Although wikis appear to have been reported as effective tools for
   educators, uncertainty exists as to their effectiveness in achieving
   student learning outcomes. The aim of this integrative review was to
   examine the current evidence on the impact of wilds on student learning
   in courses requiring collaborative or co-developed assignments or
   activities. The authors searched several electronic databases for
   relevant articles and used R. Whittemore and K. Knafl's (2005)
   integrative review method to analyze and synthesize the evidence.
   Twenty-five articles met the selection criteria for this review, and
   four major themes for wiki use were identified: (a) writing skills, (b)
   collaboration, (c) knowledge acquisition, and (d) centralized
   repository. Although wilds have been found useful in improving student
   learning outcomes and hold great potential as an instructional strategy
   to aid students in learning various skills and gaining new knowledge,
   more research is needed on their effectiveness, especially in the area
   of nursing education.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a
   learner-created virtual patient (VP) curriculum for postgraduate year 2
   surgical residents.
   DESIGN: Using a social-constructivist model of learning, we designed a
   learner-created VP curriculum to help postgraduate year 2 residents
   prepare for their in-training surgical examination. Each resident was
   assigned to create a VP curriculum based on the learning objectives for
   this examination, and VP cases were then disseminated to all residents
   for completion. To measure the learning effects of the curriculum,
   participants completed 2 simulated in training examinations, both at the
   beginning and at the end of the intervention. Study participants also
   participated in a focus group and completed an online questionnaire
   about the perceived learning value of the curriculum.
   SETTING: The study was conducted at the McGill University Health Centre,
   a tertiary care hospital in Montreal, Canada.
   PARTICIPANTS: In total, 24 residents from 7 surgical specialties
   completed both the pretest and posttest, as well as took part in the
   creation of a VP curriculum. Of those 24 residents, only 19 residents
   completed the cases created by their peers, with 7 completing greater
   than 50\% of the cases and 12 completing less than 50\%. In all 17
   residents responded to the online questionnaire and 11 residents
   participated in the focus group.
   RESULTS: The VP curriculum failed to improve scores from pretest
   (59.6\%, standard deviation = 8.1) to posttest (55.4\%, standard
   deviation = 6.6; p = 0.01) on the simulated in training examination.
   Nonetheless, survey results demonstrated that most residents felt that
   creating a VP case (89\%) and completing cases created by their peers
   (71\%) had educational value. Overall, 71\% preferred active
   participation in a curriculum to traditional didactic teaching. The
   focus group identified time-related constraints, concern about the
   quality of the peer-created cases, and questioning of the relationship
   between the curriculum and the Surgical Foundations examination as
   barriers to the success of the curriculum.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that a learner-created VP curriculum did
   not improve scores on a mock in training examination, residents viewed
   this intervention as a valuable educational experience. Although there
   were barriers to the implementation of a learner-created curriculum, it
   is nonetheless important to try and integrate pedagogical concepts into
   the instructional design of curricula for surgical residents. (C) 2016

Title = {{Virtual Knowledge Brokering: Describing the Roles and Strategies Used by
   Knowledge Brokers in a Pediatric Physiotherapy Virtual Community of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Knowledge transfer in pediatric rehabilitation is
   challenging and requires active, multifaceted strategies. The use of
   knowledge brokers (KBs) is one such strategy noted to promote clinician
   behavior change. The success of using KBs to transfer knowledge relies
   on their ability to adapt to ever-changing clinical contexts. In
   addition, with the rapid growth of online platforms as knowledge
   transfer forums, KBs must become effective in virtual environments.
   Although the role of KBs has been studied in various clinical contexts,
   their emerging role in specific online environments designed to support
   evidence-based behavior change has not yet been described. Our objective
   is to describe the roles of, and strategies used by, four KBs involved
   in a virtual community of practice to guide and inform future online KB
   interventions.
   Methods: A descriptive design guided this study and a thematic content
   analysis process was used to analyze online KB postings. The Promoting
   Action on Research in Health Sciences knowledge transfer framework and
   online andragogical learning theories assisted in the coding. A thematic
   map was created illustrating the links between KBs' strategies and
   emerging roles in the virtual environment.
   Results: We analyzed 95 posts and identified three roles: 1) context
   architect: promoting a respectful learning environment, 2) knowledge
   sharing promoter: building capacity, and 3) linkage creator: connecting
   research-to-practice. Strategies used by KBs reflected invitational,
   constructivism, and connectivism approaches, with roles and strategies
   changing over time.
   Discussion: This study increases our understanding of the actions of KBs
   in virtual contexts to foster uptake of research evidence in pediatric
   physiotherapy. Our results provide valuable information about the
   knowledge and skills required by individuals to fulfill this role in
   virtual environments.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to explore the
   relationship between students' learning styles and their online
   participation in a blended learning course, and second, to investigate
   the relationships of students' online participation with their learning
   achievement and with course satisfaction. A total of 78 undergraduate
   students from a general education course called Digital Citizenship took
   part in the study. All the participants were required to participate in
   four different types of online activity: information access, interactive
   learning, networked learning and materials development. The study used
   the method of partial least squares to explore the relationships between
   different constructs. The results indicate that students' learning
   styles were significantly related to online participation and that
   online participation in networked learning and materials development was
   significantly related to their learning achievement and course
   satisfaction. This study highlights not only the crucial role of
   learning styles in online participation but also the importance of
   individual constructivism and social interaction for effective online
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the net generation are born and grow up in a digital world.
   They are different in attitudes and behavior from their parents and
   teachers who had to adapt to digital trends. The introductory part of
   the paper analyzes their typical characteristics and their special,
   new-millennium style of learning and gaining knowledge. These skills,
   which are supported by leading contemporary paradigms (constructivism
   and connectivism), have provoked interesting changes in the theory and
   practice of education, but frequently neglected upbringing outcomes.
   This paper, based on the researched literature, examines possible
   influences of digital media on the formation of habits and creation of
   new patterns of behavior that are practiced in learning and everyday
   activities such as speed, multitasking, searching for information. It
   researches their immediate profitability and wide span of attention that
   results in lack of patience, perseverance, superficiality,
   thoughtlessness and physical and mental laziness. Although the new wave
   of Internet usage is being associated with positive educational
   qualities such as sharing, mutual help, support, honesty and tolerance,
   there are also some negative sides of it, specifically irresponsible and
   incorrect behavior towards others (electronic violence, disrespect for
   intellectual property), but also oneself (false self-presentation, (no)
   self-criticism and invasion of privacy).
   Since modern technology is forming the young generation and becoming an
   important force in shaping modern society, the conclusion emphasizes
   that with positive changes in the educational domain, attention should
   also be directed towards developing educational qualities such as
   perseverance, consistency, patience, criticism and self-criticism,
   responsible behavior, mutual respect and appreciation.
   It should be noted that, in the Croatian language, education and
   upbringing are different terms, which is why in the English version we
   used the terms education and upbringing separately.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on the civic education course at Universitas Terbuka
   (UT). Its purpose was to design a new approach for the online tutorial
   for the course by analyzing the literature related to online and
   distance education and investigating participant feedback on the current
   offering of the course and tutorial, which is a compulsory course in all
   programs at UT. The study draws from the community of inquiry framework,
   which promotes a social constructivist approach as well as teaching
   about democracy by example. This model is intended to create meaningful
   learning experiences for students in a reformulated civic education
   course, in which they would learn to think critically through
   interacting with classmates, experiencing collaborative learning, and
   supporting fellow students in learning activities and processes. In this
   model, learning is seen as occurring within the community through the
   interaction of social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching
   presence where, students are able to develop civic competences, namely
   civic knowledge, civic skills, and civic dispositions, as well as
   experience a democratic interaction that forms the core of civic
   interactions in a democratic society.}},

Abstract = {{The flipped classroom is a blended, constructivist learning environment
   that reverses where students gain and apply knowledge. Instructors from
   K-12 to the college level are interested in the prospect of flipping
   their classes, but are unsure how and with which students to implement
   this learning environment. There has been little discussion regarding
   flipping the classroom with students who are less academically prepared,
   specifically those students at open-enrollment colleges. Students at an
   open-enrollment college differed in their perceptions of the flipped
   classroom from those perceptions reported by instructors in advanced
   placement high school chemistry classes or chemistry at competitive
   colleges and universities. The focus of this paper is to provide readers
   with insights about flipping a general chemistry class at an
   open-enrollment college. This study compared high school class rank and
   mathematics placement level to overall course grades in two different
   iterations of the flipped classroom and lecture learning environments.
   The results of the ANOVA indicated that mathematics level explained
   17.6\% of the variance in course grade (R-2 = 0.176, F(1,84) = 17.131, p
   < 0.001) and class rank explained 20.965\% of the variance in course
   grade (R-2 = 0.208, F(1,84) = 20.965, p < 0.001). Students who are less
   academically and mathematically prepared should have a very structured
   learning environment with continual instructor feedback and prescribed
   preclass activities. This communication summarizes one of the invited
   papers to the ConfChem online conference Flipped Classroom, held from
   May 9 to June 12, 2014 and hosted by the ACS DivCHED Committee on
   Computers in Chemical Education (CCCE).}},

Abstract = {{The creation of online platforms that establish new learning
   environments has led to the proliferation of institutions offering
   online learning programmes. However, the use of technologies for
   teaching and learning requires sound content specialization, as well as
   grounding in pedagogy. While gains made by constructivism and
   observational learning are well documented, research addressing online
   practices that best encourage constructivist and observational learning
   in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) contexts is limited.
   Using a phenomenological methodological approach, this research explored
   the lived experiences of online learning programme facilitators at an
   Open and Distance Learning higher education institution. The findings of
   this research study revealed that facilitators did not use
   constructivist and observational learning pedagogies to a large extent
   in their interaction with students. It is concluded that during the
   curriculum planning phase, facilitators should decide on methods and
   media to arouse the students' attention and stimulating constructivist
   and observational learning amongst students during online courses. This
   also implies a more reasonable facilitator-student ratio because large
   numbers of students per facilitator proves not feasible in online
   learning. The paper concludes by providing guidelines for the
   facilitation of interactive online learning programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: With the uptake of distance learning (DL), which has been
   marginal for most clinical academics, teaching contexts, traditional
   power structures and relationships have changed, leaving lecturers
   potentially disenfranchised. DL has caused a distinct change in academic
   roles, but academic and institutional routines have remained unchanged.
   Information surrounding the changes is confusing and lacks clear
   guidance.
   Aim: To provide a pragmatic outline of roles, responsibilities,
   obstacles and solutions for clinical academics involved in DL.
   Method: A two-year action research project was carried out examining the
   academic role when developing and delivering a 20 credit post graduate
   DL module in Clinical Education at Newcastle University. It entailed
   three strands which were ``active{''} for two weeks at a time in which
   all activities had to be completed. Sixteen students participated in the
   module consisting of independent activities, facilitated discussion
   forums, wikis, required reading, individual and group tasks.
   Pedagogically, it was based on heavily on Garrison's (2012) and Salmon's
   (2008) work on constructivism and online communities.
   Results: Institutions need a clear plan and a change of culture. Roles
   have emerged including: administrator, manager, team leader knowledge
   expert, moderator and facilitator.
   Conclusions: Universities struggle to engage staff with DL due to its
   unrecognised and (many academics believe) unsustainable workload. These
   12 tips provide academics and managers involved in clinical education
   with clear guidance surrounding strategies that inform practice. New
   roles have emerged, work habits must be revolutionised and changes in
   routine must be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Connect for organic chemistry is an online learning tool that gives
   students the opportunity to learn about all aspects of organic chemistry
   through the ease of the digital world. This research project consisted
   of two fundamental questions. The first was to discover whether there
   was a difference in undergraduate organic chemistry content knowledge
   between students at a public institution who complete homework
   assignments online and those who complete homework assignments on paper.
   The second was to determine what kind of effect online homework had on
   student learning. Courses were designated at random to perform either
   online homework or traditional homework. At the end of the semester,
   students were asked to fill out a survey regarding their thoughts on the
   homework method used for their course. Students' exam grades were then
   analyzed. Students who utilized the Connect homework program did
   significantly better than those who completed traditional homework (p <
   0.006, n = 112). The ACS average exam percentile score for sections
   using online homework was higher, 59.5, than those who used paper
   homework, 45.9. From the surveys, students mentioned that feedback and
   ease of use were the primary advantages to the online homework system.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we introduce the online version of the board game
   Diplomacy as a pedagogical tool to teach about the strengths and
   limitations of constructivism, liberalism, and realism. Beyond helping
   students learn about the three paradigms, the game has two additional
   benefits over traditional role-playing simulations. First, the online
   nature of the game allows it to take place outside of class, freeing up
   more class time, and creating fewer opportunity costs for instructors
   who want to use simulations. Second, Diplomacy allows for a more
   straightforward method of assessment because it has clear rules that
   apply equally to all students. Plus, the online version provides a
   platform that gives instructors better insight into student
   participation. Using data, we show that students enjoyed the game, saw
   it as educational, and liked the fact that they played it outside of
   class. We conclude that online Diplomacy and outside-of-class
   simulations can be used as helpful tools to teach about international
   relations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the hype and speculation about the role massively open online
   courses (MOOCs) may play in higher education, empirical research that
   explores the realities of interacting and learning in MOOCs is in its
   infancy. MOOCs have evolved from previous incarnations of online
   learning but are distinguished in their global reach and
   semi-synchronicity. Thus, it is important to understand the ways that
   learners from around the world interact in these settings. In this
   paper, we ask three questions: (1) What are the demographic
   characteristics of students that participate in MOOC discussion forums?
   (2) What are the discussion patterns that characterize their
   interactions? And (3) How does participation in discussion forums relate
   to students' final scores? Analysis of nearly 87,000 individuals from
   one MOOC reveals three key trends. First, forum participants tend to be
   young adults from the Western world. Secondly, these participants
   assemble and disperse as crowds, not communities, of learners. Finally,
   those that engage explicitly in the discussion forums are often
   higher-performing than those that do not although the vast majority of
   forum participants receive ``failing{''} marks. These findings have
   implications for the design and implementation of future MOOCs, and how
   they are conceptualised as part of higher education. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to explore how a community of
   practice promoted the creation and sharing of new knowledge in
   evidence-based manual therapy using Wenger's constructs of mutual
   engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire as a theoretical
   framework.
   MethodsWe used a qualitative approach to analyze the discussion board
   contributions of the 19 physiotherapists who participated in the 10-week
   online continuing education course in evidence-based practice (EBP) in
   manual therapy. The course was founded on community of practice,
   constructivism, social, and situated learning principles.
   ResultsThe 1436 postings on 9 active discussion boards revealed that the
   community of practice was a social learning environment that supported
   strong participation and mutual engagement. Design features such as
   consistent facilitation, weekly guiding questions, and collaborative
   assignments promoted the creation and sharing of knowledge. Participants
   applied research evidence to the contexts in which they worked through
   reflective comparison of what they were reading to its applicability in
   their everyday practice. Participants' shared goals contributed to the
   common ground established in developing collective knowledge about
   different study designs, how to answer research questions, and the
   difficulties of conducting sound research.
   DiscussionAn online longitudinal community of practice utilized as a
   continuing education approach to deliver an online course based on
   constructivist and social learning principles allowed geographically
   dispersed physiotherapists to be mutually engaged in a joint enterprise
   in evidence-based manual therapy. Advantages included opportunity for
   reflection, modeling, and collaboration. Future studies should examine
   the impact of participation on clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{While education has been both open and online, the sizeable enrolment
   numbers associated with massive open online courses (MOOCs) are somewhat
   unprecedented. In order to gauge the significance of education at scale,
   this article analyses specific examples of massive participation derived
   from E-learning and Digital Cultures, a MOOC from the University of
   Edinburgh in partnership with Coursera. Student-created content, user
   statistics, and survey data are illustrated to examine the experiences
   and repercussions of engaging with educational activity where
   participants number in the tens of thousands. This activity is shown to
   mirror established instructionist or constructivist approaches to
   pedagogy. However, rather than working with ``massiveness,{''} these
   positions are suggested to oppose large participant numbers. Concluding
   remarks propose an irreducible diversity of participation, rather than a
   generalised categorisation of ``student,{''} and call for future
   considerations of the MOOC to move beyond individualism and
   self-interest.}},

   mechanisms by implementing intelligent agents in a VLE under a
   constructivist learning model and further developed an e-learning
   effectiveness framework by integrating educational and IS theories. An
   empirical field experiment involving 228 university students was
   conducted. The findings suggested that personalized e-learning
   facilities enhance online learning effectiveness in terms of
   examination, satisfaction, and self-efficacy criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In educational discourse on human learning (i.e. the result of
   experience) and development (i.e. the result of maturation), there are
   three fundamental theoretical frameworks, - behaviourism, cognitivism
   and constructivism, each of which have been applied, with varying
   degrees of success, in online environments. An ecological framework of
   human learning and development in interactive learning environments is
   proposed. Such an inclusive paradigm organizes the fundamental
   theoretical assumptions of behaviourism (i.e. automated learning),
   cognitivism (i.e. recall, understanding, analysis, synthesis,
   evaluation, creativity, problem solving) and constructivism (i.e.
   private and shared meaning). Based on review of the literature,
   behaviourism is best conceptualized as a learning theory; constructivist
   theoretical assumptions are best applied to cognitive development
   including private online experience (cognitive constructivism) and
   shared online experience (social constructivism). Cognitivism is a
   particularly relevant theoretical orientation in understanding both
   human learning and development in interactive learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The University of Calgary's Rural Integrated
   Community Clerkship anchors final-year medical student education in 9
   months of family medicine. The purpose of this pilot study was to
   evaluate the Family Medicine Preceptor Online Development (FM POD)
   program, designed to meet the faculty development needs of rural
   preceptors facing challenges of geographical distribution and time
   constraints.
   METHODS: The theoretically based program used a blended learning
   approach, beginning with a face-to-face workshop to strengthen
   participants' social presence during online interactions to follow.
   Asynchronous narrated presentations supplied foundational knowledge
   prior to facilitated synchronous web conferences, where participants
   shared experiences and co-constructed new knowledge. The program was
   evaluated using mixed methods, including surveys and focus group
   discussion.
   RESULTS: Evaluation tools generated data with high internal consistency
   reliability; focus group information substantiated and enriched the
   quantitative survey data. Participants enjoyed collaborating with
   colleagues and rated their learning experiences highly, reporting
   meaningful and statistically significant increases in mean comfort with
   all the precepting skills taught: giving effective feedback, using
   questions to teach, teaching communications skills, helping learners in
   difficulty, and making teaching time-efficient. All effect sizes were
   large. Increased comfort with distance learning technologies was a
   positive consequence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results support the applicability of principles of social
   constructivism, experiential learning, and reflective learning in these
   participants. The program was highly rated and effectively increased
   participants' comfort with teaching skills, offering practical
   off-the-peg modular faculty development in basic teaching skills for
   distributed faculty. Participants appreciated the flexible delivery
   format, which course developers found readily adaptable for additional
   topics.}},

   the use of wilds in an EFL writing classroom. The aim was to explore the
   extent to which wilds can facilitate collaboration and promote foreign
   language acquisition through a social constructivist perspective. The
   instruments used in this study include two online questionnaires,
   interviews with randomly selected participants and students' reflections
   on using wikis for collaborative writing. Findings indicate that wilds
   increase the students' motivation to learn English, enhance their
   writing confidence and promote their initiatives for social
   constructivist learning. Most of the students enjoyed performing group
   tasks in the wiki-meditated environment because they found it to be
   engaging, challenging and interesting. The results also suggest that
   collaboration on a wild in an EFL setting can contribute to both
   language development and social interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Social interactions to supplement learning and asynchronous tools to
   facilitate exchange of quality ideas have gained much attention in
   information systems education. While various systems exist, students
   have difficulty with deep processing of complex instructional materials
   (e.g., concepts of a theory and pedagogical support mechanisms derived
   from a theory). This research proposes a theoretical framework that
   leverages attention guidance in a social constructivist approach to
   facilitate processing of central domain concepts, principles, and their
   interrelations. Using an open source anchored discussion system, we
   designed a set of instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance
   functionalities involving dynamic manipulation of text font size similar
   to tag clouds. We conducted an experimental study with two small groups
   of first-year doctoral students in a blended-learning classroom format.
   Students in the control group had no access to attention guidance
   functions. Students in the treatment group used instructor-based
   attention guidance functionality and then switched to peer-oriented
   attention guidance functionality. The evaluation compared focus,
   content, and sequential organization of students' online discussion
   messages with heat maps, content analysis, sequential analysis, and
   statistical discourse analysis to examine different facets of the
   phenomenon in a holistic way. The results show that in areas where
   students struggle to understand challenging concepts, instructor-based
   attention guidance functionality facilitated elaboration and negotiation
   of ideas, which is fundamental to higher order thinking. In addition,
   after switching to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality,
   students in the treatment group took the lead in pinpointing challenging
   concepts they did not previously understand. These findings indicate
   that instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance
   functionalities offer students an indirect way of focusing their
   attention on deep processing of challenging concepts in an inherently
   open learning environment. Implications for theory, software design, and
   future research are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between students' use of PeerWise, an online tool that
   facilitates peer learning through student-generated content in the form
   of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and achievement, as measured by
   their performance in the end-of-module examinations, was investigated in
   5 large early-years science modules (in physics, chemistry and biology)
   across 3 research-intensive UK universities. A complex pattern was
   observed in terms of which type of activity (writing, answering or
   commenting on questions) was most beneficial for students; however,
   there was some evidence that students of lower intermediate ability may
   have gained particular benefit. In all modules, a modest but
   statistically significant positive correlation was found between
   students' PeerWise activity and their examination performance, after
   taking prior ability into account. This suggests that engaging with the
   production and discussion of student-generated content in the form of
   MCQs can support student learning in a way that is not critically
   dependent on course, institution, instructor or student.}},

Abstract = {{Blog-based teaching portfolios have been operating in a teacher
   education program since 2007. The blog-based teaching portfolios provide
   a constructivist and interactive learning environment where students,
   in-service teachers, and faculty staff members negotiate, discuss,
   reflect and evaluate individual understandings of teaching practice and
   experience. Studies have shown a positive impact of blog-based teaching
   portfolios on learning and professional developments. However, the
   evaluation of online learning communities (OLCs) which evolve from the
   compilation process and the interactive nature of blog-based teaching
   portfolios is lacking. In this paper, a qualitative case study approach
   was adopted to study the functions and characteristics of an effective
   OLC in fulfilling the design objectives of blog-based teaching
   portfolios. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six student
   teachers, three in-service teachers who also played the role as mentors
   in the blog-based teaching portfolios, and one faculty staff member who
   was the blog designer. The interview data were transcribed, coded and
   analyzed to identify the perceived functions and characteristics of an
   effective OLC in blog-based teaching portfolios. Interview data revealed
   two major components and related ten factors which affected the
   effectiveness of an OLC from members' perspectives. It was suggested
   that technology proficiency is not a key factor in constructing digital
   teaching portfolios. What makes the learning process more meaningful and
   sustainable are active participation and high quality interaction which
   require collaborative/interactive course elements together with
   commitment and support from OLC members. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Social question answering: Analyzing knowledge, cognitive processes and
   social dimensions of micro-collaborations}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{109-120}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Social question answering (SQA) services are social media applications
   that are dedicated platforms where users ask, answer and rate content
   interactively, resulting in building a community of users. SQA services
   are rich in micro-collaborations which are referred to as brief,
   informal episodes of collaborative information seeking.
   Micro-collaborations have gathered interest in the educational domain
   because of new ways of engaging students in collaborative information
   seeking. Previous studies in the field of computer supported
   collaborative learning are based on various theoretical and
   methodological approaches that examined different units of analysis.
   Yet, amid on-going research efforts, there still persist a lack of an
   overarching understanding on how micro-collaborations enhance
   collaborative learning in SQA services. Hence, this study aims to
   understand the distribution of knowledge, cognitive process and social
   dimension that learners demonstrate in micro-collaborations in a SQA
   service. Data was collected from Piazza, a SQA service used for teaching
   Java programming for bachelor students and analyzed using the integrated
   framework. Findings suggest that micro-collaborations in SQA services
   promote all the three dimensions including knowledge, cognitive process
   and social dimensions. The findings reveal that social dimension in
   micro-collaborations promote collaborative learning by enhancing
   community building, developing self-identity, and improving relational
   dynamics, which in turn support learning in various knowledge levels and
   improve the cognitive process in learning. This study serves as a
   foundation for researchers to study social dimension along with
   knowledge and cognitive process, to understand the dynamics of
   micro-collaborations involved in collaborative learning. As for
   practitioners, they can look into creating environments for
   collaborative learning rich in micro-collaborations in both physical as
   well as digital space. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the design and evaluation of a blended
   online/face-to-face course completed by more than 6000 learners
   throughout the United States of America and internationally. The
   educational impact was monitored using a variety of evaluation
   strategies. The results, in terms of achieved knowledge and overall
   satisfaction, indicate that a focus on online instruction combined with
   face-to-face, hands-on activities showed statistically significant
   improvement in the learners' understanding of the course material, while
   also validating the impact of the curriculum in their workplace. As
   illustrated through the blended course design, this study further showed
   that online learners with greater improvement in their pre- and posttest
   scores also exhibited significantly greater likelihood in demonstrating
   competency in several areas during the hands-on portion of the course.
   In particular, participants working in the information systems field
   exhibited the highest mean difference score (21.49) on the pre- and the
   posttests, while those working in the laboratory had the lowest (12.17).
   Likewise, the odds that participants who reviewed the course contents
   sought to further understand their job roles was 58.2 times greater for
   those in information systems, while it was only 19.0 times greater for
   laboratory staff, than those who did not review their job roles.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to report on how Web 2.0 tools in an
   online information literacy instruction course aligned with ACRL's
   Information Literary Competency Standards for Higher Education. A
   qualitative case study was undertaken on an online graduate course
   related to information literacy instruction. Data collected included:
   course activities, assignments, emails, online discussions, and surveys.
   The educational theory of constructivism and its adherence to
   reflection, active learning, and social interaction was used to find
   patterns in the data. Activity theory provided a framework for data
   analysis and interpretation related to the patterns of activities that
   took place while students used each Web 2.0 tool. Web 2.0 was found to
   enhance all five information literacy standards. These standards related
   to collaboration, information organization, creativity, discussion, and
   technology education. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many education institutes are planning to use virtual worlds to offer
   distance education programs and to reach potential students globally.
   However, the success of such programs depends on students' willingness
   to use virtual worlds for learning continuously. Students' learning
   continuance helps to decrease the drop-out rate of the programs.
   Motivated thus, this study uses the lenses of the balanced
   thinking-feelings model and socio-constructivism to model how students'
   personal learning and social learning experiences influence virtual
   world learning continuance. Our results show that the utilitarian and
   hedonic values are critical to learners' continuous intention of virtual
   world learning, and they are influenced by learners' social learning
   experiences. Social learning factors are also found to interact with
   students' personal learning factors to influence their perceived
   utilitarian and hedonic values of virtual world learning. The findings
   provide theoretical implications by integrating information systems
   theories and education psychology to understand the factors influencing
   the virtual world learning continuance in a systematic way. The findings
   also provide educators empirical evidence on what influences users'
   learning continuance in virtual worlds.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has focused on the development of effective online
   problem based learning (PBL). However, there is a need for research to
   examine experiences of online PBL in those new to online learning. This
   study used a single module blended approach to examine the student
   experience of online PBL in a group of postgraduates new to online
   learning. This employed one problem scenario for each group (four
   students per group) as the central component of the module. Asynchronous
   discussion boards were used to facilitate the learning process with
   other forms of delivery used as appropriate. Focus group interviews
   revealed that students believed online PBL developed skills related to
   employability and information retrieval/evaluation. Online PBL was seen
   as beneficial for developing ideas and critiquing information. However,
   the artificial nature of the discussion board space was a barrier for
   some students, as was anxiety about online participation in the PBL
   tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the possibilities that tacit knowledge could
   provide for social constructivist pedagogies; in particular, pedagogies
   for online learning. Arguing that the tacit dimension of knowledge is
   critical for meaning making in situated learning practices and for a
   community of practice to function, the article considers whether
   individuals' online identities can be employed as a way to reveal their
   tacit knowledge. Furthering the discussion, the article analyses tacit
   knowledge within a community and suggests that social capital theory
   could productively be employed for utilising tacit knowledge within any
   given online learning community.}},

Abstract = {{This empirical study explores whether authentic tasks designed
   specifically for deliberately grouped students have an effect on student
   perception of teaching presence and student cognitive gains. In one
   library research class offered in an express session online, the
   instructor grouped students randomly. In a second online library
   research class, students were deliberately grouped according to major.
   Assignments were designed and targeted to these two groups with IRS
   approval. The students were surveyed using a modified Community of
   Inquiry survey. Analysis of survey results using Chi Square tests
   indicates that this constructivist approach to teaching and learning is
   effective for teaching library research methods; there was a
   statistically significant measure of overall grade achievement in the
   deliberately grouped class.}},

Abstract = {{Web 2.0 technologies have a range of possibilities for fostering
   constructivist learning and observational learning. This is due to the
   available applications which allow for synchronous and asynchronous
   interaction and the sharing of knowledge between users. Web 2.0 tools
   include online social media applications which have potential
   pedagogical benefits. Despite these potential benefits, there is
   inadequate utilization of online social media applications in learning
   management systems for pedagogical purposes. Reasons cited for the
   limited uptake of online social media applications in learning
   management systems include the lack of consideration regarding the
   pedagogical benefits of these applications (Christie \& Garrote-Jurado,
   2009, pp. 273-279). There is limited information regarding experiences
   of the use of online social media that foster constructivist and
   observational learning. Using a qualitative meta-ethnographic approach,
   this article explores the experiences of students and instructors
   regarding online social media applications for constructivism and
   observational learning. Constructivist criteria (Baviskar, Hartle, \&
   Whitney, 2009, pp. 543-544) and observational learning, based on
   Bandura's (2001, pp. 265-299) social cognitive theory, formed the
   theoretical grounding for this research. The findings suggest that
   discussion forums are ideal for the stimulation of constructivism and
   observational learning in online learning programmes.}},

Abstract = {{This study tried to ascertain a possible relationship between the number
   of student moderators (1, 2, and 3), online interactions, and critical
   thinking of K-12 educators enrolled in an online course that was taught
   from a constructivist approach. The course topic was use of technology
   in special education. Social network analysis (SNA) and measures of
   critical thinking (Newman, Webb, \& Cochrane, 1995) were used to
   research and assess if there was a difference in interaction and
   critical thinking between 1, 2, or 3 student moderators who facilitated
   a forum discussion of an assignment in an online course. The same course
   was repeated over three years. Each year either 1, 2, or 3 students
   moderated. The analysis indicated more discussion per non-moderating
   student with the three student moderated group. Using SNA we found that
   there was only one noticeable difference among the three groups which
   was in the value of network centralization. Using critical thinking
   measures the three student moderator group scored higher in five of the
   eight critical thinking categories. Variations in instructor presence in
   the online courses may have influenced these findings.}},

Abstract = {{International students have become an important part of many
   universities, both through the income they provide and the diversity
   they bring to student populations. Studying in a foreign country can be
   challenging, requiring students to adapt to unfamiliar educational
   cultures. With the integration of online technologies into higher
   education, this can raise an additional set of challenges. This paper
   presents research that explored Chinese international students'
   experiences of studying online at an Australian university, drawing on
   qualitative data collected from focus groups and interviews with Chinese
   students, interviews with their Australian teachers and course
   documentation. The findings indicate a strong culture clash between
   these students' educational dispositions, shaped by their previous
   learning experiences in China, and the online pedagogic practices, which
   were underpinned by a constructivist approach. This resulted in
   detrimental educational and psychological consequences, with
   participants reporting limited development of their knowledge, and
   feelings of isolation and anomie. The findings suggest that
   investigating the interplay between learners' prior and current
   educational experiences is important in understanding how students
   experience teaching practices.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the turmoil of a worldwide economic crisis, the health sector
   remains largely understaffed, and the nursing shortage represents a
   major issue that jeopardizes graduate nursing education. Access to
   education remains a challenge, particularly in rural and remote areas.
   This article reports the process of developing an asynchronous online
   qualitative research course. This online course was piloted among 16
   interdisciplinary students. Participants agreed that experiential
   learning was useful to understand the intricacies of qualitative
   research. Within this constructivist approach, students were immersed in
   real-life experiences, which focused on the development of skills
   applicable to qualitative research. Based on the findings, we suggest
   that constructivism and the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID)
   model (a four-part approach for fostering the development of complex
   skills) represent valuable ontological and pedagogical approaches that
   can be used in online courses. Triangulating these two approaches is
   also congruent with the student-centered philosophy that underpins
   nursing graduate programs.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the development and implementation of a wiki-based
   application for the delivery of educational content in dentistry. The
   Dental Procedure Education System (DPES) is a new web application that
   uses SharePoint to combine online collaborative authoring characteristic
   of wiki spaces with instructional video documentaries. Harnessing the
   wiki's versatility, DPES offers faculty members an avenue to develop an
   authoritative source of information for both students, through DPES Pro,
   and the public at large, through DPES Public. Principles of cognitive
   theory of multimedia learning, constnictivist theory, and collaborative
   writing were employed in the development of DPES. An authoring protocol,
   with a clearly defined sequence of steps, was established in order to
   keep the production of the DPES procedures consistent and predictable.
   Initial, anecdotal user reports indicate that DPES is well received
   among dental students and faculty members. Expected outcomes and
   benefits of DPES use are discussed, and directions for research are
   proposed.}},

   interaction into online courses to support learning. Based on social
   constructivism theory, this study explored which types of interaction
   are most predictive of students' sense of community in online graduate
   courses at a regional comprehensive university. Surveys were used to
   measure sense of community and the frequency and importance of nine
   learner-learner interactions.
   Interactions that were most predictive of sense of community were
   introductions, collaborative group projects, sharing personal
   experiences, entire class discussions, and exchanging resources. The
   interaction that offered the highest payoff to instructors was
   exchanging resources. The article discusses implications for online
   course design.}},

Abstract = {{Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Taiwan often use an
   outdated lecture-memorization methodology resulting in low motivation,
   confidence, and ability on the part of students. Innovative educators
   are exploring use of technology, such as videoconferences with native
   speakers, to enrich the classroom; however few guidelines have been
   developed for effective videoconference instructional design. This study
   used a survey methodology, Exploratory Factor Analysis, and Structural
   Equation Modeling to examine which elements of learning via
   videoconferencing most beneficially affect motivation, confidence, and
   ability. The study found that long-term changes in ability are best
   predicted by enjoyment of the learning experience. The data also
   suggested that even a small amount of authentic interaction in English
   made students more comfortable in applying their skills, more confident
   in what they learned, and more inspired to make global, cross-cultural
   connections. Therefore, EFL instructors should strive to use
   student-centered active learning and to offer their students
   interactions with native speakers, including interactions via distance
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the design of a system that can be used in
   different teaching and learning activities, in particular teaching
   assembly language programming and basic computer architecture for
   undergraduate studies. The system can be a self-learning tool for
   students. On the other hand, teachers can utilize this system to develop
   prototype systems and to demonstrate theories pertaining to operations
   of microprocessor-based systems. This educational tool includes hardware
   and software components, which were developed by the authors. The design
   of this system is based on principles of constructivism and learning is
   through hands-on experience. The system is very flexible and users can
   incorporate new modules for more advanced learning. Due to its
   flexibility and ease of use, it can also be employed as a supplementary
   tool for teaching other engineering subjects. Data collected from our
   evaluation study shows that majority of users found the system easy to
   use. In this article, features of the system, as well as its design and
   evaluation results are presented. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title = {{New technology, new pedagogy? Employing video podcasts in learning and
   teaching about exotic ecosystems}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the experiences of undergraduate university students
   in response to the employment of video podcasts to support learning and
   teaching about exotic ecosystems. Six, 15-20-minute podcasts were made
   accessible to students through a virtual learning environment, either
   online or to download to mobile technology. The students were free to
   watch the podcasts whenever and wherever they chose to. The perceived
   and actual effectiveness of the technology was assessed by written
   questionnaire, focus groups and summative assessment results. Students
   agreed that the podcasts were effective in supporting learning and
   teaching on the course, largely by offering a flexible and visual
   learning experience. The podcasts were also perceived as a useful
   resource for revision and assessment, providing visual images that
   stimulated factual recall and highlighted knowledge gaps. There were no
   significant differences, however, in examination essay grades comparing
   cohorts prior to and post adoption of podcasts. The key to improving the
   student learning experience appears to lie not in adopting new pedagogy,
   but in reflexively developing the existing pedagogic strategies employed
   by both teachers and learners. Of primary importance is uniting the
   individual learning experience of podcasts with group exploration and
   critical discussion in a collaborative learning framework.}},

Abstract = {{This article argues for a flexible model of learning for adults which
   allows them to make choices and contextualise their learning in a manner
   appropriate to their own professional practice whilst also developing as
   a member of a learning community. It presents a design based around
   online `learning activities' which draws on ideas of constructivism,
   collaborative learning and reflective practice. The model was developed
   for adult learning in Higher Education, and has been adapted and
   extended to a number of different programmes. Implementation of the
   model for the Teaching Qualification (Further Education) has been the
   subject of an interpretative evaluation using a multiple methods
   approach. Learners' experiences of this programme together with issues
   associated with the application of the model to other programmes are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{40-56}},
Abstract = {{The role of social presence as defined by the community of inquiry (CoI)
   framework is critiqued through a review of recent literature. Evidence
   is presented that questions the actual extent of knowledge
   co-construction that occurs in most higher education settings and
   therefore challenges the framework's underlying assumption of the need
   for sustained, contiguous, two-way communication in higher-level online
   learning environments. The CoI framework has evolved from the
   description of a learning process within a social constructivist
   paradigm to an empirically testable construct in an objectivist
   paradigm. Related research results indicate that social presence does
   not impact cognitive presence in a meaningful way and that best teaching
   practices suggested by CoI-based studies are informed by objectivist,
   cognitively oriented learning theories. These suggest that higher-order
   cognition may be achieved through wide and varied combinations of
   learner-teacher, learner-content, and learner-learner interaction.
   Controlled studies can and should be undertaken to compare learning
   outcomes using sustained, contiguous, two-way communication to other
   learning models. To facilitate this, subcategories of social and
   teaching presences need to be revamped and analysis adjusted to separate
   processes that support explicitly group-based learning activities from
   those used by individual students.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to explore the correlates among teachers'
   epistemological beliefs concerning Internet environments, their web
   search strategies and search outcomes. The sample of this study included
   105 teachers from 63 grades 1 to 9 schools in Taiwan. The results show
   that the teachers with more advanced epistemological beliefs concerning
   Internet environments could utilize more sophisticated web search
   strategies (i.e. less irrelevant information-selecting) to filter and
   organize the information than those with less advanced beliefs. Also,
   the sophistication of epistemological beliefs was positively correlated
   to the search outcomes for open-ended questions. Hence, epistemological
   beliefs concerning Internet environments play an important role in
   web-based learning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses how an elementary-level future school in Singapore
   implements and uses various open-source online platforms, which are
   easily available online and could be implemented with minimal software
   cost, for the purpose of teaching and learning. Online platforms have
   the potential to facilitate students' engagement for independent and
   collaborative learning, enhance student-teacher interactions, and
   develop students' technological skills. A framework is constructed to
   facilitate the conceptualisation of the various pedagogical approaches
   for learning using such online platforms - learning from and with
   technology is proposed. Learning from technology leans itself more
   towards the didactic and behaviouristic theories whereas learning with
   technology has its origin from the constructivism and social
   constructivism paradigms. In addition, both the didactic and
   constructivist pedagogical approaches are applicable for online learning
   as they could be used to achieve different outcomes depending on the
   learning objectives. Implicit in the findings is also the importance of
   the teachers' commitment and competencies and good infrastructural and
   technical support in the use of technologies for teaching and learning
   in an educational setting.}},

Abstract = {{Self-testing is a means to check learning effect. Besides time-space
   restriction, there are many deficiencies in traditional offline
   self-testing. With the development of information technology, learners
   can have self-testing on the Internet. Self-testing on Internet, namely,
   web-based self-testing, overcomes timespace limitation of traditional
   offline self-testing, but there are still several disadvantages such as
   monotony and lack of interaction In the article, a web-based
   self-testing system with some features of Web 2 0 is designed and
   implemented, aiming at overcoming the weaknesses of current online
   self-testing system. Firstly, taking English self-testing as an example,
   the framework of the system and functions of its main modules is
   designed according to theories of social learning and constructivism as
   well as the idea of Web 2.0 and the characteristics of server-side
   programming Secondly, in accordance with the design above, a new system
   is implemented for English learners primarily by using HTML, JavaScript,
   PFIP, and MySQL comprehensively The role and duty of webmaster are also
   described briefly. To test the system. some English learners were
   invited randomly to use it, and feedback Information was collected from
   them after a period of time It is shown by feedbacks that most learners
   are satisfied with the system, and the system is of distinct features
   and favorable practicality compared with other systems, but it still
   needs to be improved in the design of user interface and some other
   details Results in the article demonstrate that the new system can
   overcome the shortcomings of current systems to some extent. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effectiveness of three different online writing
   activities in formal university education forums blogs and wikis
   Constructivism - reflective and collaborative learning fostered by
   scaffolding - provides a main support for their use in education Prior
   research regarding the use of blogs and wikis especially in language
   education is reviewed The lack of detailed examination to determine
   learning outcomes the absence of an evaluation mechanism and the special
   difficulty language education holds for their appreciation are noted
   The latter half of the paper presents exploratory research executed by
   the authors on the usage of forums blogs and wikis in an English as
   foreign language (EFL) blended learning course in a university in Tokyo,
   Japan A mixed-method approach was applied with survey, interview and
   text analysis used for triangulation The survey revealed students
   positive perceptions of the blended course design with online writings -
   wikis being the most favorable followed by blogs and forums Qualitative
   text analysis of forum and villa writings showed progress in their
   ability to differentiate English writing styles The interview script
   analysis clarified the different merits students perceived from each
   activity The variations provided by the blended course design served
   well in meeting challenges and were fun for them (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{A graduate course on cultural diversity, based in constructivist theory
   and structured on the Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of
   Healthcare Services model, was developed and taught through classroom
   and online methods. The following research questions were explored: 1)
   Can an educational experience, built on constructivist learning theory
   tenets, change students' perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, and skills
   in the area of cultural competence? 2) Does the delivery method, online
   or traditional classroom, influence the degree of change? The study used
   a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest control group design using the
   Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among
   Healthcare Professionals Revised. Findings showed significant changes (p
   < 0.001) in cultural competence scores and subscores for all learners
   with both teaching modalities based on interval scale and in categories
   of cultural knowledge, skill, desire, and overall competence based on a
   nominal scale. The untaught construct of cultural desire showed the most
   significant improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the work and conclusions of a working group
   established by the European Chemistry Thematic Network (ECTN). The aim
   of the working group was to identify potential areas for innovative
   approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry in Higher
   Education, and to survey good practice throughout the EU. The paper
   starts by identifying and justifying the need for innovation in the
   methods used to teach chemistry in higher education to deal with
   challenges arising from the rapidly changing nature of higher education.
   This leads on to a brief discussion of each of ten distinct areas
   identified by the working group, where innovation is considered to offer
   opportunities for enhancing the student learning experience in higher
   level chemistry education. The importance of improved training in
   pedagogy and pedagogical content knowledge for new lecturers is also
   stressed.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to understand teachers' perspectives on their roles in
   higher education, their views about the adoption of a
   social-constructivist approach to teaching and learning and the
   integration of online collaborative learning in blended learning
   environments in higher education from a cross cultural perspective. We
   interviewed 60 Chinese teachers from Beijing Normal University and
   Capital Normal University in Beijing, China and 30 Flemish teachers from
   Ghent University in Flanders, Belgium. The results revealed differences
   as well as specific similarities in perspectives between the Chinese and

Abstract = {{This case study explores the learning experiences of three international
   students who were enrolled in an online master's program offered by a
   large university in Canada. The aim of the study was to understand the
   international students' experiences with, and perspectives on, the
   online learning environment. Findings indicate that previous education
   and especially language proficiency strongly impacted the learning of
   these students in this environment. Non-native English speakers required
   considerably more time to process readings and postings and to make
   postings themselves. Their lack of familiarity with the details of North
   American culture and colloquial language made it difficult to follow
   much of the course discussions. They also tended to avoid socializing in
   the course, which left them at the periphery of course activities. Based
   on these findings, the authors make the following recommendations for
   designers and instructors of online courses: 1) Raise the English
   language proficiency requirement for graduate admissions into online
   programs because the text-based communication in a CMC space requires
   interpreting messages without non-verbal cues; 2) Ensure that online
   distance education course designers are aware of the needs and
   expectations of international students; and 3) Combine the design
   principles from both traditional and constructivism theories.}},

Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{27-47}},
Abstract = {{Mobile collaborative learning is considered the next step of on-line
   collaborative learning by incorporating mobility as a key and
   breakthrough requirement. Indeed, the current wide spread of mobile
   devices and wireless technologies brings an enormous potential to
   e-learning, in terms of ubiquity, pervasiveness, personalization,
   flexibility, and so on. For this reason, Mobile Computer-Supported
   Collaborative Learning has recently grown from a minor research field to
   significant research projects covering a fairly variety of formal and
   specially informal learning settings, from schools and universities to
   workplaces, museums, cities and rural areas. Much of this research has
   shown how mobile technology can offer new opportunities for groups of
   learners to collaborate inside and beyond the traditional
   instructor-oriented educational paradigm. However, mobile technologies,
   when specifically applied to collaborative learning activities, are
   still in its infancy and many challenges arise. In addition, current
   research in this domain points to highly specialized study cases, uses,
   and experiences in specific educational settings and thus the issues
   addressed in the literature are found dispersed and disconnected from
   each other. To this end, this paper attempts to bridge relevant aspects
   of mobile technologies in support for collaborative learning and
   provides a tighter view by means of a multidimensional approach.}},

Abstract = {{This study implemented an online peer assessment learning module to help
   36 college students with the major of pre-school education to develop
   science activities for future instruction. Each student was asked to
   submit a science activity project for pre-school children, and then
   experienced three rounds of peer assessment. The effects of the online
   peer assessment module on student learning were examined, and the role
   of Scientific Epistemological Views (SEVs) in the learning process was
   carefully investigated. This study found that student peers displayed
   valid scoring that was consistent with an expert's marks. Through the
   online peer assessment, the students could enhance the design of science
   activities for future instruction; for instance, the science activities
   became more creative, science-embedded, feasible and more suitable for
   the developmental stage of pre-school children. More importantly,
   students with more sophisticated (constructivist-oriented) SEVs tended
   to progress significantly more for designing science activities with
   more fun, higher creativity and greater relevancy to scientific
   knowledge, implying that learners with constructivist-oriented SEVs
   might benefit more from the online peer assessment learning process.
   These students also tended to offer more feedback to their peers, and
   much of the peer feedback provided by these students was categorized as
   guiding or helping peers to carefully appraise and plan their science
   activity projects. This study finally suggested that an appropriate
   understanding regarding the constructivist epistemology may be a
   prerequisite for utilizing peer assessment learning activities in
   science education.}},

Abstract = {{Change and development in work settings for better working practice
   through projects has become essential. And, in this context, learning
   through working practice is constructed by participatory action
   research. This work-based research has a significant role to contribute
   innovative practice of Distance Education Institute at Eastern
   Mediterranean University by EUA norms. The research aimed to investigate
   implementing constructivist approach into online course designs to
   develop learning and skills of the online students based on teamwork
   inspiration within the institute. Action research approach employed in
   this qualitative research in order to provide insights on how to prepare
   and design online courses based on constructivist approach. Training,
   in-depth interviews, documentary analysis, focus group, research diary
   and semi-structured interviews were employed as data collection
   techniques to gather large amount of data from online tutors, and
   members of institute in relation to their collaborative efforts within
   the process. Furthermore, triangulated data were analyzed based on
   content analysis in this inductive journey. The results revealed that
   members and the tutors had no prior knowledge and experience on team
   work culture and the principles of constructivist approach into online
   course designs. In this respect, collaborative efforts and synergy power
   of the tutors within participatory action research resulted in better
   working performance for change and development research actions. This
   research is significant for considering change and development in
   working practice in relation to implementing constructivist approach
   into online course designs as it is one of the critical success factor
   for the quality in online practices. In addition, the research opens an
   academic debate which work based projects through participatory action
   research need to function in working practices to propose change and
   development for the quality improvements within higher education
   institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Educators have long debated the usefulness (or otherwise) of final
   examinations; a debate that has typically revolved around the relative
   merits of closed-book exams, open-book exams, take-home exams or their
   substitution by some other assessment format (eg, project work). This
   paper adds a new dimension to the debate by considering how the final
   examination assessment instrument might be enhanced through harnessing
   the power of technology, more specifically, how the learner experience
   of the final examination might be made more authentic and, in the
   process, more constructively aligned with stated learning outcomes. The
   authors report on the latest findings of an ongoing research project
   evaluating the effectiveness of `open-book, open-web' (OBOW)
   examinations delivered by an online university, vis-a-vis a closed-book,
   invigilated alternative. Earlier research had indicated that the OBOW
   model receives the strong endorsement of students in a number of
   respects, most particularly the quality of the learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess the online social constructivist learning
   environment (SCLE) and student perceptions of the outcomes of the online
   introductory module of pharmacy professional practice that was designed
   based on social constructivism theory.
   Design. The online introductory module of pharmacy professional practice
   in pharmaceutical marketing and business was carefully designed by
   organizing various activities, which were intended to encourage social
   interaction among students. The Constructivist Online Learning
   Environment Survey (COLLES) was applied to assess the SCLE. Course
   evaluation questionnaires were administered to assess student
   perceptions of this online module.
   Assessment. The result from the COLLES illustrated the development of
   SCLE in the course. The students reported positive perceptions of the
   course.
   Conclusion. An online introductory module of pharmacy professional
   practice in pharmaceutical marketing and business was effective in
   promoting SCLE.}},

   significant changes in epistemological beliefs and beliefs about

   less value effort in learning and believed more in innate ability.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to investigate how web-based technology
   could be utilized and integrated with real-life scientific materials to
   stimulate the creativity of secondary school students. One certified
   science teacher and 31 seventh graders participated in this study.
   Several real-life experience science sessions integrated with online
   teaching were used for one semester. The study used an interpretive
   methodology. which was qualitative analysis rather than quantitative
   analysis. The main data included students' online data, interviews,
   videotape recordings and the teacher's journals. The results also showed
   that this study provided information to enhance students' expression of
   sensitivity, fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration of
   scientific creativities. Students' creativity was motivated by the
   online interactivities and the teacher's inquiry. The difficulties and
   limitations of the teaching and learning environment included strong
   attraction toward the Internet, poor ability of students in word
   processing and discussion online, students' utilitarianism due to the
   pressure of entrance examination, and large amount of time spent on
   explorative activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on an inquiry-oriented framework, WebQuests facilitate the
   construction of effective learning activities. Developed by Bernie Dodge
   and Tom March in 1995 at the San Diego State University, WebQuests have
   gained worldwide popularity among educators in the kindergarten through
   grade 12 educational sector. However, their application at the college
   and university levels is not well documented. WebQuests enhance and
   promote higher order-thinking skills, are consistent with Bloom's
   Taxonomy, and reflect a learner-centered instructional methodology
   (constructivism). They are based on solid theoretical foundations and
   promote critical thinking, inquiry, and problem solving. There is a role
   for WebQuests in nursing education. A WebQuest example is described in
   this article.}},

   constructs of cultural awareness, knowledge, skill, and encounters. The

   and classroom courses were highly effective and well received by the
   students. Student course evaluations and outcome assessments of
   students' cultural competence levels, as compared to precourse levels,
   provided supportive evidence that the course design produced intended
   outcomes. Course resources are shared, making them available for use by

Abstract = {{This article concerns the influence of news presentation on the web. The
   study had two primary goals. The first was to test the effects of
   interactivity on learning, and the second was to explore the role of
   motivation in learning from interactive media. Hypotheses were tested
   using an experimental design. Study participants were assigned one of
   four web news stories with structures that encouraged varying degrees of
   interactivity. The results of hypothesis testing were heavily dependent
   on which measure of learning was employed. A traditional multiple-choice
   test of recognition verified an effect of motivation but not of
   interactive behaviour. A comprehension measure of learning, supported by
   the cognitive constructivism theory of learning employed in this study,
   supported an effect of interactive behaviour but not of motivation.
   Explanations for the findings are proposed and implications for mass
   communicators discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Two disparate research programs have addressed the challenge of
   instructional multimedia design. One, based on cognitive load theory,
   has focused on ways of reducing unnecessary cognitive load during
   instruction to free up resources for learning. The other, based on
   constructivism, has centered on interactive multimedia, allowing
   students to build their own knowledge. Attempting to build on both
   bodies of literature, in this study, we investigated techniques that can
   raise the useful cognitive load engendered with linear multimedia.
   Participating online from home, students were pre- and posttested around
   a short multimedia intervention that explained Newton's first and second
   laws. In Experiment 1, students who watched a video dialogue involving
   alternative conceptions reported investing greater mental effort and
   achieved higher posttest scores than students who received a standard
   lecture-style presentation. In Experiment 2, two additional multimedia
   treatments were evaluated to assess the role of instructional time and
   the method of addressing alternative conceptions. In all, 272 students
   participated in the experiments. Interviews suggest that students
   adopted a more active approach to understanding the material if
   alternative conceptions were raised. In addition, students who watched
   the dialogue judged themselves to be similar to the student in the
   multimedia. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Journal = {{INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{A constructivist approach in teaching and learning requires one to
   change various habitual ways for thinking (von Glasersfeld 1995). There
   is a need for different ways of thinking and doing things, if
   conventional education is to realise a constructivist worldview.
   Educators and trainers in both academic and work sectors are promoting
   the use of the Internet for flexible and learner-centred learning. The
   intention of this paper is to examine the popular online learning
   pedagogy and question if the emerging formal higher education practices
   advocate a constructivist view of knowledge. The discussion begins with
   an introduction to the constructivist view. Although participation in
   online discourse is popularly recognised as social constructivism, the
   problematisation and critique of online practices help to challenge the
   formal education interpretation of constructivism. References to the
   emerging research and established literature on learning are used to
   identify the normalising influences of academic courses that require
   compulsory participation in online discussions. The choice to learn in
   silence is discussed in reference to the power differences influencing
   online discussion participation. The emerging online pedagogy is
   challenged for its limited appreciation of diverse learning preferences
   that is a central aspect of constructivism. The conclusion of the paper
   draws from data analysis in the author's doctorate study, which is in
   progress. It proposes how online and offline educators who aim for
   learner-centred and constructivist learning could use the insights
   gained from this analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines how a learning management system (LMS), coupled with
   sound pedagogical approaches, is used to develop learning communities
   for students undertaking a problem-based learning university course.
   Students use the LMS to undertake team-based work, including meetings,
   communications. and submission of assessments. Data collected on
   students' usage of the LMS communication technology, and quotes from
   students' reflective portfolios. demonstrate that effective learning
   `communities' are being created in virtual space. Despite never meeting
   in person, off-campus students formed functional teams and reported
   developing a great sense of `community', which fostered mentoring and
   collaborative learning. The LMS supported the development of an online
   learning environment that encouraged reflective thought and dialogue
   with others, with of which are critical to transformative learning and
   social constructivism. The learner was compelled to become an active
   participant in the learning process, which allowed students to
   appreciate the value of participation, trust, mutual respect, and

Abstract = {{Language differences and diverse cultural norms influence the
   transmission and receipt of information. The online environment provides
   yet another potential source of miscommunication. Although distance
   learning has the potential to reach students in cultural groups that
   have been disenfranchised from traditional higher education settings in
   the past, intercultural miscommunication is also much more likely to
   occur through it. There is limited research examining intercultural
   miscommunication within distance education environments. This article
   presents the results of a qualitative study that explored the
   communication experiences of Canadian faculty and Aboriginal students
   while participating in an online baccalaureate nursing degree program
   that used various delivery modalities. The microlevel data analysis
   revealed participants' beliefs and interactions that fostered
   intercultural miscommunication as well as their recommendations for
   ensuring respectful and ethically supportive discourses in online
   courses. The unique and collective influences of intercultural
   miscommunication on the experiences of faculty and students within the
   courses are also identified. Instances of ethnocentrism and othering are
   illustrated, noting the effects that occurred from holding dualistic
   perspectives of us and them. Lastly, strategies for preventing
   intercultural miscommunication in online courses are described.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of weblog use on individual learning
   in the context of university senior-Level business education. As an
   emergent form of personal communication, weblogs enable people to
   publish their thoughts as webpages, and to share information and
   knowledge. Recognizing the potential impact of weblogs on knowledge
   expression and sharing, this research sought to empirically examine
   whether the continuous use of weblogs as online learning logs would
   affect student learning performance. The assumption was that effective
   use of weblogs promoted the constructivist models of learning by
   supporting both cognitive and social knowledge construction, and by
   reinforcing individual accountability in learning. Results from an
   Information Systems undergraduate course with 31 participants indicated
   that the performance of students' weblogs was a significant predictor of
   the learning outcome (while traditional coursework was not). Moreover,
   individuals' cognitive construction effort to build their own mental
   models and social construction effort to further enrich/expand knowledge
   resources appeared to be two key aspects of the constructivist learning
   with weblogs. Our results imply the potential benefit of using weblogs
   as a knowledge construction tool and a social learning medium.}},

Abstract = {{This study represents an effort to construct a learning framework for
   knowledge building and collective wisdom advancement in a virtual
   learning community (VLC) from the perspectives of system wholeness,
   intelligence wholeness and dynamics, learning models, and knowledge
   management. It also tries to construct the zone of proximal development
   (ZPD) of VLCs based on the combination of Vygotsky's theory of zone of
   proximal development and the trajectories of knowledge building. The aim
   of a VLC built on the theories of constructivism, situated learning, and
   knowledge building, etc., is to apply individual intelligence to online
   learning, bring the advantages of collaborative learning and collective
   wisdom into play, solve difficult problems in independent learning, and
   lead to the integration and sublimation of collective wisdom through
   long-term individual interactions, collaborative learning and knowledge
   building.}},

Abstract = {{Within an authentic assessment regime, a student is evaluated in terms
   of their ability to demonstrate application of a body of knowledge to a
   scenario situated in an actual, or a near replica of a real-world
   context. At Universitas 21 Global (U21Global), a completely online
   graduate school backed by 16 universities from around the world, the
   entire pedagogical model is founded on such an approach. One unique
   feature of the U21Global model is its interactive examination instrument
   which harnesses the power of the various information and communication
   technologies (ICTs). This instrument, referred to as the Open-Book
   Open-Web (OBOW) exam, presents students with a description of a
   simulated business problem using multimedia. They are then asked to
   assume a particular role and make recommendations about how to go about
   solving the problem. Feedback to date indicates that students are
   generally very positive about OBOW exams. On the minus side, the
   construction of OBOW exams presents a number of challenges. Not least of
   these is the steep learning curve it presents for exam authors
   unaccustomed to working within this paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to determine the efficiency of virtual learning
   environments based on social knowledge construction on learners'
   achievement and attitudes. In this direction, this study tried to
   compare the virtual learning environments based oil social knowledge
   construction With traditional learning environments in the course titled
   ``Human Development and Learning{''}. The second year students who
   attended ``Human Development and Learning{''} course at Firat
   University, Faculty of Technical Education, during the fall semester of
   2002-2003 school year participated in the research. The pre-test and
   post-test control group research design was used in the study. The Study
   included three groups, each consisting of 24 members. The first
   experimental group acted only in ``virtual learning environments based
   on social knowledge construction{''}, the second experimental group
   acted both in ``virtual learning environments based on social knowledge
   construction and traditional learning environments{''}, and the control
   group acted only in ``traditional learning, environments{''}.
   The major findings in this study indicated that; the students in the
   experimental group were found more successful considering the average
   opoints of the post-test. Both of thee experimental groups were more
   successful than the control group at the comprehension level. This study
   exposed positive findings of the virtual learning environments based on
   social knowledge construction about learning and teaching. It can be
   recommended that it is important to give learners more initiative under
   less control. It can be Said that it will be useful to implement courses
   such as literature, sociology, history, and philosophy in this
   environment in order to determine its efficiency from different points.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a field experiment on online
   examinations facilitated by collaboration support systems. In
   particular, it examines collaborative learning and virtual teams through
   online examinations as an assessment procedure, compared to traditional
   examinations. Assessment is increasingly regarded as an important part
   of the learning process. Applying constructivism and
   collaborative-learning theories, the collaborative examination process
   features students' active participation in various phases of the exam
   process through small group activities online. A 1 x 3 field experiment
   evaluated the collaborative online exam compared with the traditional
   in-class exam, and the participatory exam, where students participated
   in the online exam processes without groups. Data analysis using results
   from 485 students indicates that collaborative examinations
   significantly enhance, interactions and the sense of an online learning
   community and result in significantly higher levels of perceived
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to describe the development, validation
   and use of the Constructivist Multimedia Learning Environment Survey (
   CMLES). This questionnaire assesses teachers' and students' perceptions
   of the learning environment when students use online multimedia programs
   while teachers use constructivism as a referent for their teaching. The
   design of the questionnaire was based on a constructivist approach to
   learning and focused on the process of learning with the multimedia
   program and on the nature of that program. Before the use of the CMLES
   becomes widespread, it was important to determine whether it is valid
   and reliable. Therefore, a study involving 221 students in 12 high
   school classrooms into statistical validation and interpretive
   validation of the questionnaire was undertaken. For this sample of Grade
   10 and 11 students who completed the actual and preferred forms of the
   questionnaire, the CMLES scales demonstrated a high degree of internal
   consistency reliability ( with alpha reliability coefficients ranging
   from.73 to.82), as well as satisfactory factorial validity and
   discriminant validity. Therefore, the study supports the reliability and
   validity of the CMLES for assessing students' and teachers' perceptions
   of one important aspect in evaluating learning environments which
   promote the use of multimedia programs and constructivist learning
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally our UK higher education establishments have majored on a
   lecturer instructing a group of students. The focus has been very much
   on transferring a body of knowledge to a set of learners using a variety
   of teaching methods. The target in many establishments has been on the
   individual learner and their performance. Conversation, when used was a
   means of clarifying the learning that had been set by the teacher. With
   the advent of online teaching and learning this mould might be
   challenged. Can we develop another approach? This article looks at some
   of the ways in which the design and practices of Talk 2 Learn, an online
   community, may reflect the thinking of Wenger and Vygotsky. It also
   begins to explore through the Talk 2 Learn example why it can be a
   useful addition to the traditional UK higher education models of
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Many in nurse education have partially adopted the Internet as a
   pedagogical approach. This has highlighted serious contentious issues
   for educators. These include, pedagogical vs. technological approaches
   to teaching, face-to-face vs. online communication and classroom vs.
   online teaching. This paper attempts to reassure educators about this
   new Internet-based pedagogy, by applying traditional educational
   theories and discussions on curriculum to web-based teaching. In
   particular, cognitive learning theories such as constructivism and the
   process model of curriculum development are discussed. These provide a
   solid theoretical framework from which to expand the Internet-based
   pedagogical approach among those whose interest is the promotion of
   learning. The paper concludes with the implications of web-based
   teaching for the personal and professional development of nurse
   educators. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   which examined the nature of the cohort learning experience in an online
   master's program, from both faculty and student perspectives. After
   describing this online master's program in adult education designed from
   a social constructivist theoretical frame, this paper discusses two
   primary areas of findings related to cohort learning. First, were those
   related to the ongoing negotiation of the learning process: the
   importance of an opening residential; a consistent but flexible cohort
   structure; and building ongoing relationships. Second, were those
   related to the ongoing construction of knowledge: the role of team-
   teaching and the cohort model in transformative learning; the
   application of theory to real life practice, and the value of group
   support and collaboration in conducting research and constructing
   knowledge. Implications for practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Thomas Kuhn has had an impact in all academic fields. In science
   education, Kuhnian themes are especially noticeable in conceptual change
   research, constructivist theorizing, and multicultural education
   debates. Unfortunately the influence is frequently compromised by
   researchers having a limited understanding of Kuhn's original ideas,
   little exposure to the tradition of philosophical opposition to Kuhn's
   theories, and minimal appreciation of how Kuhn progressively qualified
   his initial ``irrationalist{''} views of scientific development. One
   lesson to be learnt is that the science education community should more
   seriously and effectively engage with on-going debates and analysis in
   the history and philosophy of science. This is the same lesson that was
   learnt from the science education community's wholesale embrace of
   logical empiricism during the 1950s and 1960s. Another lesson is that
   there are powerful disciplinary, institutional, and subcultural barriers
   that mitigate against science educators seriously engaging with
   historical and philosophical scholarship. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The effects of changing to an online delivery mechanism within a third
   year, undergraduate, module have been evaluated against the lecturing
   staff's intended move towards a student-centred, constructivist learning
   approach. It has been suggested that this type of delivery can increase
   critical thinking and active learning for students. In the study
   described in this paper, qualitative analytical techniques were used in
   order to explore students' experiences of online delivery. The study
   addressed their perceptions about online methods as well as the
   educational implications of their patterns of usage of online resources.
   The findings suggest that students were quick to overcome anxieties
   about online learning but generally did not develop any significant
   degree of discussion. It is argued that a move to online delivery needs
   a greater attention to design and development of facilitator skills than
   has been previously recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Since online learning has a different setting from the conventional
   classroom, online educators need to use some special techniques and
   perceptions to lead to success, Moreover, adults have special needs and
   requirements as learners compared with children and adolescents, thus
   online educators should know how adults can learn best because of their
   special characteristics. Philosophical and methodological shifts also
   affect instruction. Many researchers have suggested that constructivism
   should be applied in distance education. Thus, this paper attempts to
   examine the impact of constructivism in online learning environments
   when focusing on adult learners. The author develops the connection
   between constructivism and adult learning theory. In addition, the paper
   proposes instructional guidelines using the constructivist approach in
   online learning for adults.}},

Abstract = {{The recent trend of placing courses online is having a profound impact
   on higher education. This trend has caused considerable debate on the
   positive and negative effects of online instruction in higher education
   (Ellery, Estes, \& Forbus, 1998; Rintara, 1998). Student learning is
   arguably the most important facet of the pedagogical process, regardless
   of the course dissemination or delivery method. The purpose of this
   article is to discuss student learning within the context of online
   instruction and to analyze the issues surrounding online implementation
   of physical education/kinesiology coursework. Constructivism is offered
   as a theoretical framework for enhancing student learning in the online
   environment and a process for implementing courses is proposed.}},
